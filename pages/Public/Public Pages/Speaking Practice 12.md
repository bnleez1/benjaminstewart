**Instructions**: This week's speaking practice will be with your speaking partners for the week. Share an experience from a past festival or fair that you attended where something interesting, funny, unexpected, etc. happened? Share your story with your speaking partner. A good conversation will include 1) webcams turned on, 2) fluid conversation (little awkward gaps in the conversation), 3) expressing one's opinion on the topic. We'll go in order, Team #1 first, Team #2 second, etc.
**Speaking partners will be assigned just before we begin our speaking practice.**
