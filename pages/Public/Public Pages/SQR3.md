The KWL questioning technique is a way of engaging students in learning by activating their prior knowledge, stimulating their curiosity, and assessing their understanding of the topic. [KWL stands for Know, Want to Know, and Learned](https://www.verywellfamily.com/kwl-what-is-kwl-2162741)[1](https://www.verywellfamily.com/kwl-what-is-kwl-2162741). Here are some steps on how to use the KWL questioning technique in the classroom:
- Before reading or introducing a new topic, ask students to brainstorm what they already know about it and write their responses in the Know column of a KWL chart. You can use a large chart paper, a whiteboard, or a projector to display the chart for the whole class, or you can have students work individually or in groups using smaller charts. Encourage students to share their ideas with each other and with the class.
- Next, ask students to generate questions about what they want to know or wonder about the topic and write them in the Want to Know column of the KWL chart. You can guide them by using question words such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. Help them to formulate clear and specific questions that can be answered by reading or researching the topic.
- Then, have students read the text or explore the topic using various sources of information, such as books, articles, websites, videos, etc. Ask them to look for answers to their questions and take notes of any new information they learn. You can also provide them with additional questions or prompts to focus their attention on key concepts or details.
- Finally, ask students to review what they have learned and write their findings in the Learned column of the KWL chart. You can also have them compare their answers with their initial questions and see if they need to revise or add anything. Have them share their learning outcomes with each other and with the class. You can also ask them to reflect on how the KWL technique helped them to learn more effectively and meaningfully.
Some examples of topics that you can use the KWL questioning technique for are:
- Animals: You can have students learn about different types of animals, such as mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, etc. You can ask them to name some examples of each type, describe their characteristics and habitats, and explain how they adapt to their environment.
- Solar System: You can have students learn about the sun, the planets, and other celestial bodies in our solar system. You can ask them to identify the names and order of the planets, describe their features and orbits, and compare their sizes and distances from the sun.
- Ancient Civilizations: You can have students learn about the history and culture of ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, Greece, Rome, China, etc. You can ask them to locate them on a map, describe their achievements and contributions to society, and compare their similarities and differences.
The KWL questioning technique is a useful strategy for teaching and learning in any subject area. [It can help students activate their background knowledge, generate interest and inquiry, and enhance their comprehension and retention of new information](https://www.teachervision.com/graphic-organizer/using-kwl-classroom)[2](https://www.teachervision.com/graphic-organizer/using-kwl-classroom)[3](https://iosrjournals.org/iosr-jrme/papers/Vol-11%20Issue-2/Series-6/E1102062935.pdf).
