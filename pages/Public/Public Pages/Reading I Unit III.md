# **Unit 3: Leisure and the World Around Us**
# Stage 1 - Desired Results
## Established Goals
This four-week unit explores the themes of nature, entertainment, travel, and sports. Students will develop a range of reading and critical thinking skills to understand and engage with information about the world around them and the activities they enjoy in their free time. They will practice predicting, inferring, scanning for details, and summarizing to make informed decisions and share their experiences with others.
### Transfer
Students will be able to independently use their learning to 1) plan and make informed choices for leisure activities, such as choosing a movie, planning a hike, or booking a trip; 2) critically evaluate information from various sources (reviews, articles, travel guides) to meet their personal needs and interests; 3) engage in conversations about their hobbies and experiences, sharing opinions and summaries of events.
### Meaning
### Understandings:
Students will understand that:
- Our leisure choices—how we have fun and relax—reflect our personal values and cultural backgrounds.
- Interacting with nature, art, and new places can change our perspective and contribute to our well-being.
- Strategic reading allows us to quickly find what we need and deeply understand what is important in any text.
### Essential Questions:
- What is the importance of leisure and fun in our lives?
- How does our relationship with nature affect us and our environment?
- How do we choose our entertainment? What makes something "entertaining"?
- What is the value of traveling and experiencing new places?
- What can we learn from sports beyond the game itself?
### Acquisition
### _Learners will know…_
Students will know:
- Vocabulary related to nature and the environment (e.g., forest, mountain, ocean, climate, conservation).
- Vocabulary for entertainment (e.g., movie, concert, exhibit, review, genre, plot).
- Vocabulary for travel (e.g., destination, itinerary, booking, accommodation, sightseeing).
- Vocabulary for sports (e.g., team, player, rules, score, championship).
### _Students will be skilled at…_
Students will be skilled at:
- Obtaining general and specific information.
- Identifying main ideas.
- Scanning for specific details.
- Inferring meaning and author's purpose.
- Predicting content and outcomes.
- Summarizing information.
# Stage 2 - Assessment Evidence

> [!important] All graded assignments are listed below.
## Performance Task:
**"My Perfect Weekend Getaway" Proposal**
Students will research and create a proposal for a two-day trip. The proposal must be presented as a digital slideshow or a detailed written itinerary for a friend. It must include:
1. **Destination & Nature:** Choose a destination in Mexico known for its natural beauty. Scan a travel guide or website to find key information (location, best time to visit) and infer the best outdoor activity to do there.
2. **Entertainment:** Find an entertainment option for one evening of the trip (e.g., a local festival, a movie, a concert). Predict whether it would be enjoyable based on a review and summarize the event.
3. **Travel & Lodging:** Research and scan for travel logistics (e.g., bus times, ticket prices) and accommodation options.
4. **Local Activity/Sport:** Find a local sporting event or popular recreational activity to watch or participate in. Read an article about it to identify the main idea and infer its importance to the local culture.
This task requires students to integrate all four topics and use all the target skills (scanning, inferring, predicting, summarizing) to create a coherent and persuasive plan.
## Other Evidence:
- Quizzes on vocabulary for each topic.
- "Speed Reading" drills where students scan articles about sports or travel to find specific facts against the clock.
- Graphic organizers where students predict a story's plot based on the title and opening paragraph.
- Short written summaries of movie reviews or articles about environmental issues.
- Exit tickets asking students to infer the author's opinion in a short text.
# Stage 3 - Learning Plan
## Learning Plan (WHERETO)
### **Week 1: Nature**
- **W (Where/Why):** Introduce the unit and the "Weekend Getaway" project. Explain that understanding our natural world is the first step to enjoying it and protecting it.
- **H (Hook):** Show breathtaking photos of natural landscapes in Mexico (like the Sierra Gorda in Querétaro or Hierve el Agua in Oaxaca). Ask: "What do you feel when you see these places?"
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce nature vocabulary. Students will read articles about local ecosystems or national parks. They will practice obtaining general information, identifying main ideas (e.g., "This park is important for migrating birds"), scanning for specific data (e.g., "How many species live there?"), and inferring the author's feelings about the topic.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** In groups, students will create a small "eco-tourism" poster for a place in Aguascalientes, like Cerro del Muerto, and get feedback from peers.
- **E (Evaluate):** Students will answer comprehension questions about a short article on an environmental topic, focusing on main idea and specific details.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide texts with different levels of complexity. Offer a glossary of difficult terms for support.
- **O (Organize):** The week is organized to build foundational vocabulary and reading skills in the context of the natural world.
### **Week 2: Entertainment**
- **W:** Connect to the project: "Once you've enjoyed nature, what will you do in the evening? Let's explore entertainment."
- **H (Hook):** Play trailers for two very different movies. Ask students to predict the plot and which one they would prefer to see and why.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce entertainment vocabulary. Students will read movie reviews, concert announcements, and articles about different hobbies. They will practice predicting content, identifying the meaning of descriptive words from context, and writing a one-paragraph summary of a review.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** Students will write their own short review of a song or TV show and have a partner check if the summary is clear and accurate.
- **E (Evaluate):** Students will read a movie review and write a short summary, which is evaluated for accuracy and conciseness.
- **T (Tailor):** Allow students to choose the type of entertainment they want to read about (music, film, video games, etc.) to increase engagement.
- **O (Organize):** The week focuses on skills of prediction and summary, which are crucial for making choices.
### **Week 3: Travel**
- **W:** Frame the week around the performance task. "This week, we'll learn the skills to plan the logistics of your amazing weekend getaway."
- **H (Hook):** Ask: "What's the best trip you've ever taken? What made it great?" Share a brief, exciting travel story.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce travel and booking vocabulary. Students will work with authentic materials like travel blogs, bus websites, and hotel listings. They will practice scanning for key information (prices, dates, times, addresses) and inferring the best option based on a set of criteria (e.g., "Find a hotel that is cheap but has good reviews").
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** In pairs, students will plan a simple one-day trip from Aguascalientes to a nearby city, like Zacatecas or Guadalajara. They must create a budget and schedule, then explain it to another pair.
- **E (Evaluate):** A task where students must scan a mock travel website to find the answers to specific questions (e.g., "What is the checkout time?").
- **T (Tailor):** Provide a template for the trip-planning activity to guide students. More advanced students can be asked to plan a more complex trip.
- **O (Organize):** This week is highly practical, focusing on applying scanning and inferring skills to real-world planning tasks.
### **Week 4: Sports**
- **W:** Introduce the final topic for the project. "Many places are famous for their sports. Let's learn how to understand and talk about them."
- **H (Hook):** Show a short, exciting clip of a famous sports moment (e.g., a winning goal). Ask: "How does this make you feel? What is happening?"
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce sports vocabulary. Students will read sports news articles and summaries of games. They will practice identifying the main idea (e.g., "Team A won because of their strong defense") and specific information (the final score). They will also practice inferring a writer's opinion or bias from the context.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** Students will work on the final drafts of their "Weekend Getaway" proposals and present them to a small group for feedback before the final submission.
- **E (Evaluate):** The final "Weekend Getaway" proposal and presentation will serve as the summative assessment for the entire unit.
- **T (Tailor):** Allow students to choose a sport that interests them for the practice activities. Provide a clear rubric for the final project so students know the expectations.
- **O (Organize):** The week focuses on the final content area while dedicating significant time to synthesizing all unit skills for the performance task.
