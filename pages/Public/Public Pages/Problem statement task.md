## Tasks
- Begin reading and reflecting about problems that you have faced in the English language learning classroom either as a teacher and/or learner.
- Consider using AI to brainstorm possible problems and solutions. See [[AI Prompt Sequencing for Narrowing Down a Researchable Topic]].
- Add three possible problems that you are considering at this point to the Unit I Matrix found in the [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n0BJE-9OhW8bexhKhbcAsIxHr4Q4a8x2?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n0BJE-9OhW8bexhKhbcAsIxHr4Q4a8x2?usp=sharing) folder. Later, you’ll need to zero in on one problem to focus on this semester (and likely the next semester as well).
- Incorporate [[Reading comprehension methods, strategies, and teaching tactics]] that help you narrow down your topic (See [[Narrowing Down a Topic]]).
- Complete a one-sentence problem statement that consists of a topic, a (specific) indirect question, and the significance in the Unit I Matrix mentioned above.
- Submit to the [Teams assignment](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/66aeee93-507d-479a-a3ef-8f494af43945/classroom?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22version%5C%22%3A%5C%221.0%5C%22%2C%5C%22config%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22classes%5C%22%3A%5B%7B%5C%22id%5C%22%3A%5C%2237f8bc4d-4369-4afc-8ead-928d00895995%5C%22%2C%5C%22assignmentIds%5C%22%3A%5B%5C%22b6f5fef5-168e-4a3a-82c7-bda9e4fcde99%5C%22%5D%7D%5D%7D%2C%5C%22action%5C%22%3A%5C%22navigate%5C%22%2C%5C%22view%5C%22%3A%5C%22assignment-viewer%5C%22%2C%5C%22appId%5C%22%3A%5C%221fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264%5C%22%2C%5C%22deeplinkType%5C%22%3A4%7D%22%2C%22channelId%22%3Anull%7D) as a pdf file.
