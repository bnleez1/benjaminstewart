- Based on your topic sentence and direct quote from Tuesday, review [[How to Paraphrase Direct Quotes- A Comprehensive Guide]] to see how paraphrase a direct quote.
- Demonstration
    
    Here are two additional direct quotes about using AI in the classroom, along with their paraphrased versions and APA citations:
    
    **Direct Quote**: “AI tools are useful in brainstorming or thinking outside the box, because you can get large language models to perform as randomness generators” (Harvard Law School, 2024).
    
    **Paraphrased**: AI tools can aid in creative thinking by acting as generators of random ideas (Harvard Law School, 2024).
    
- Demonstration
    
    **Direct Quote**: “Rather than fully embracing AI as a writing assistant, the reasonable conclusion is that there needs to be a split between assignments on which using AI is encouraged and assignments on which using AI can’t possibly help” (Chronicle of Higher Education, 2023).
    
    **Paraphrased**: Teachers should differentiate between assignments where AI use remains educative and those where it is not (The Chronicle of Higher Education, 2023).
