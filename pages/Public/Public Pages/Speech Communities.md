# Task
- Instructions (from September 3, 2025, [[Sociolinguistics Week 4 Lessons]])
    - Discuss dialogues in [Week 4](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/Sociolinguistics809/EqGepn3XB1FDhYB9jxd4rocBB42OuoBjJuK-J0JETpVzGw?e=tYCJAY) with team members based on the task and purpose. Look up any vocabulary or lexis as needed. Refer to [[Vocabulary vs. Lexis]] for more information on the differences between vocabulary and lexis.
    - Choose as a team a dialogue for each group member.
    - With your chosen dialogue, expand your dialogue to 10-15 turns using a GenAI prompt.
        
        > Sample prompt: Take this dialogue and expand it to 10 turns. Create a dialogue that includes language that is specific to the speech community, and that can cause boundaries to others outside the speech community.
        
    - With your chosen prompt, identify at least three slang terms in the dialogue that might be confusing for someone outside the speech (linguistic) community.
    - Discuss how these terms act as **boundaries** between groups (teens vs parents, insiders vs outsiders).
    - Rewrite the dialogue in “standard English” without slang. Compare how the meaning and tone change.
    - Post the two versions of the dialogue, the slang you identified, and your discussion of how boundaries between certain groups (i.e., insiders vs. outsides, etc.) exist.
- Microteaching scenarios
    
    ### **1) Scenario: Deconstructing Labels – Dialects vs. Varieties**
    
    Trainees present a short dialogue or written example showcasing a language/dialect stereotype.
    
    What task(s) might you include in your 15-minute micro-teaching lesson?
    
    **Reflection Focus:**
    
    - What pedagogical risks does labeling pose?
    - How can teachers present language variation neutrally and respectfully?
    - What approaches help students notice variation without reinforcing bias?

    ### **2) Scenario: Code-Switching in the Classroom**
    
    Trainees dramatize a short classroom interaction where a multilingual student shifts between English and their heritage language (or dialect) in response to peer questions or to assist comprehension.
    
    What task(s) might you include in your 15-minute micro-teaching lesson?
    
    **Reflection Focus:**
    
    - When and how might code-switching be strategically valued in the ELT classroom?
    - How can teachers foster awareness of code-switching as a legitimate communicative resource, rather than treating it as error?

    ### **3) Scenario: Introducing Speech Communities**
    
    Trainees prepare a brief mini-lesson introducing the concept of a speech community—e.g., a community bound by profession (like gamers), hobby, region, or online interest group.
    
    What task(s) might you include in your 15-minute micro-teaching lesson?
    
    **Reflection Focus:**
    
    - How can understanding speech communities inform lesson contextualization and learner engagement?
    - In what ways can trainers tap into learners’ communities of practice to make lessons more relevant?

    ### **4) Scenario: Variation in Englishes – A “World of Englishes”**
    
    Trainees deliver a quick presentation contrasting British, Indian, Nigerian, and Jamaican English varieties—focusing on distinct pronunciation, vocabulary, and pragmatic norms.
    
    What task(s) might you include in your 15-minute micro-teaching lesson?
    
    **Reflection Focus:**
    
    - Should ELT classrooms celebrate a single “standard” model or introduce [[Pluricentric Perspectives]]?
    - How can teacher resources be diversified to reflect the global plurality of English?
