- Complete drafting counterclaim body paragraph with team members.
- Similar to Monday's activity, based on the topic you chose from the [list of topics for constructing an argumentative essay,](https://benjaminlstewart.com/list-of-topics-for-constructing-an-argumentative-essay/)create one paragraph (below the two activities that we began yesterday) by creating a topic sentence based on the counterclaim provided and then have three classmates create two evidence sentences and one analysis sentence. Consider the following:
    - No cell phones or other devices may be used. Help each other with grammar and vocabulary and ask me as well.
    - Write one paragraph _without_ beginning a sentence on a new line.
    - The topic sentence should begin with the main clause.
    - The topic sentence should begin with a noun phrase.
    - The topic sentence should not have a linking verb in the main clause (e.g., "to be", etc.)
    - The topic sentence should be a complex sentence with either a relative clause and/or a subordinating clause.
    - The two sentences after the topic sentence should be evidence sentences (citations not required) and should be either a complex, compound, or complex-compound sentence.
    - The two evidence sentences should provide examples, details, or facts related to the topic sentence.
    - The fourth sentence should be an analysis sentence that connects the evidence to the topic sentence and should be either a complex, compound, or complex-compound sentence.
    - Below your completed paragraph, write the names of those who wrote their respective sentences.
- Example
    - Counterclaim: Homeschooling, when done effectively, can offer a tailored educational experience that addresses specific learning needs, though it requires significant commitment from parents to ensure socialization and a comprehensive curriculum.
What's the difference between examples 1 and 2 from above?

- Considering the same topic from the [list of topics for constructing an argumentative essay,](https://benjaminlstewart.com/list-of-topics-for-constructing-an-argumentative-essay/) create a four-sentence paragraph with your team by having each member write their topic sentence rebuttal and then ask that a classmate complete the next three sentences: two evidence sentences and one analysis sentence - in that order. Consider the following:
    - One a clean sheet a paper, add your name and today's date.
    - Write down your team members and a assign a number, two to four.
    - Avoiding any cell phones or other devices and rely on each other to help with grammar and vocabulary, begin writing your topic sentence as a rebuttal according to the same topic you chose last week.
    - The topic sentence should begin with the main clause (with no linking verb), should have a noun phrase as the subject, and should be a complex sentence.
    - Show me your topic sentence before passing your paper to a classmate.
    - Once you have received feedback from me, pass your paper to a team mate and have them continue writing an evidence sentence that is not a simple sentence - make sure to write one paragraph _without_ beginning a sentence on a new line for each sentence.
    - Help each other develop your sentences and to check each other's work.
    - Continue passing around your paper for that each of your four sentences comes from a different team mate. Again, avoid any simple sentences.
    - Write the number in parenthesis to indicate which team mate wrote which sentence.
    - Remember that the two evidence sentences should provide examples, details, or facts related to the topic sentence.
    - The fourth sentence should be an analysis sentence that connects the evidence to the topic sentence and should be either a complex, compound, or complex-compound sentence.
- Example
    - Rebuttal: Homeschooling can isolate children and may not provide a balanced education.
    - Example 1: Homeschooling, which requires a significant commitment from parents to ensure socialization and a comprehensive curriculum, offers a tailored educational experience that addresses specific learning needs of the student. Parents who understand their children better than most can differentiate the content based on what their children enjoy. They can also design learning experiences that give students the opportunity to explore their learning preferences such as kinestic and visual learning. Homeschooling allows parents to provide more flexibility and learning autonomy for their children by having more control over the learning experiences of their children.
    - Example 2: Homeschooling, which requires a significant commitment from parents to ensure socialization and a comprehensive curriculum, offers a tailored educational experience that addresses specific learning needs of the student. Parents who understand their children better than most can differentiate the content based on what their children enjoy. Differentiation of the learning experience is also possible by giving students the opportunity to explore their learning preferences such as kinestic and visual learning. Homeschooling allows parents to provide more flexibility and learning autonomy for their children by having more control over the learning experiences of their children.
