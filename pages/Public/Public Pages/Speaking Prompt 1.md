**Instructions**: At the beginning of class, I will present a question (twice). At which time, I will give everyone two minutes to prepare a response. Once two minutes are up, I will choose at random a person to respond. Each response should include the following: 1) webcam with your face within the frame and 2) a two-minute response, speaking clearly and loud enough to be heard.
**Tip**: Take notes to help prepare for a complete and organized response.
