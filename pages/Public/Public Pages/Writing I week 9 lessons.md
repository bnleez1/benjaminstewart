    "Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we’re going to explore the fascinating topic of renewable energy sources and their potential to replace fossil fuels.
    
    As you know, fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas have been the primary sources of energy for decades. However, they come with significant drawbacks, including environmental pollution and the release of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. This has led to a growing interest in renewable energy sources, which are considered more sustainable and environmentally friendly.
    
    Let’s start with solar energy. Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity using photovoltaic cells. One of the major advantages of solar energy is that it is abundant and inexhaustible. However, the efficiency of solar panels can be affected by weather conditions and the time of day, which means they are not always reliable as a sole energy source.
    
    Next, we have wind energy. Wind turbines capture the kinetic energy of wind and convert it into electrical power. Wind energy is also renewable and produces no emissions during operation. However, wind farms require large areas of land and can be visually intrusive. Additionally, wind patterns can be unpredictable, which can lead to inconsistent energy production.
    
    Hydropower is another significant renewable energy source. It generates electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing water, typically from rivers or dams. Hydropower is highly efficient and can produce a steady supply of electricity. However, the construction of large dams can have negative impacts on local ecosystems and communities.
    
    Lastly, let’s consider geothermal energy, which is derived from the heat stored within the Earth. Geothermal power plants can provide a constant and reliable source of energy, as they are not dependent on weather conditions. However, geothermal energy is location-specific, meaning it can only be harnessed in regions with suitable geological conditions.
    
    In conclusion, while renewable energy sources offer many benefits over fossil fuels, each has its own set of challenges and limitations. A combination of different renewable energy technologies, along with advancements in energy storage and grid management, will be essential for a sustainable energy future."

**Discuss the impact of climate change on animal habitats. Provide examples of specific animals and how their environments are being affected.**

## Two common theme and rheme patterns
### Pattern 1: Same Theme, New Rheme
In this pattern, the theme remains the same across consecutive sentences, while the rheme introduces new information each time. This helps to expand on the initial topic in a coherent manner.
**Example:**
1. **Theme:** “The new policy”**Rheme:** “will affect all employees starting next month.”
2. **Theme:** “The new policy”**Rheme:** “includes changes to the vacation schedule.”
### Pattern 2: Rheme to Theme
In this pattern, the rheme of the first sentence becomes the theme of the next sentence. This creates a logical progression of ideas and ensures a smooth flow of information.
**Example:**
1. **Theme:** “The new policy”**Rheme:** “will affect all employees starting next month.”
2. **Theme:** “All employees”**Rheme:** “will need to attend a training session.”

    3. Draft a sentence based on the demonstration.
# 🗂️ Thursday
- On a clean sheet of paper with your name at the top, use the written prompt provided in class on @Today to create a list of key words and phrases as details: what, how, why, when, where, with whom, etc. based on the following question: _Describe your favorite season of the year.
