# 🎯 **What this configuration gives you**

- Smooth automatic syncing to GitHub
    
- Minimal merge conflicts with Resilio
    
- Clean commit history (auto + manual separation)
    
- No spammy notifications
    
- Clear visual indicators in the status bar
    
- Fully readable and useful diff and history views
    
- Safe pull + commit timing
    
- Only your selected folders sync (via `.gitignore`)
    

This is the **best possible setup** for PKM, teaching materials, research writing, and multi-device workflows.

If you want, I can now generate:

📌 a **perfect `.gitignore`** for selective syncing  
📌 a **Git health-check** script to test your setup  
📌 or instructions to **verify that your commits are hitting GitHub correctly**

Just tell me: **“Check my .gitignore”** or **“Verify my sync.”**
