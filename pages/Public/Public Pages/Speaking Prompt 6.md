Each week, you'll receive a speaking prompt and will be given two minutes to answer the question. A good response is one that completely answers the question, utilizing the entire two minutes, in a logical, organized, and direct manner.**Procedure**
- One Friday at 12:00 PM sharp, I will present a question.
- I will give everyone two minutes to think about their answer.
- After the two minutes are up, I will randomly pick learners to respond to the question. I will allow two minutes for a response and will cut you off (interrupt) if you go over the allocated time.
- I will continue with the next person, randomly choosing learners until the last person has presented.
- After you have answered the question, you may remain in the online session or you may leave the session to work on your weekly podcast.**Tips**
- Arrive a few minutes early to the online session (regardless if I have joined or not).
- Take notes when listening to the question and preparing for your response. Think carefully about how you plan to organize your answer.
- Make sure you answer specifically the question being asked. Provide details or examples in your response, thinking about which question words best apply to your answer: _what, why, how, when, where, with whom_, etc.
- Use the entire two minutes to provide your response.
