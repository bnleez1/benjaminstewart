# Sociolinguistics Unit I: Foundations of Sociolinguistics

# Stage 1 - Desired Results

## Established Goals

- Students will be able to distinguish between the fundamental roles society and individual speakers play in selecting and using varieties of language within different communities, critically analyzing foundational sociolinguistic concepts relevant to the language classroom.
- **21st Century Skills:** Critical thinking, information literacy, collaboration, and communication.

### Transfer

Learners will be able to independently use their learning to analyze and respond effectively to real-world language use in diverse educational settings. They will be able to identify the sociolinguistic factors at play in a classroom (e.g., student dialects, code-switching, community norms) and make informed pedagogical decisions that are inclusive, respectful, and effective for language learners.

### Meaning

### Understandings:

Learners will understand that...

- Sociolinguistics is the study of the relationship between language and society.
- There are critical distinctions between the concepts of languages, dialects, and language varieties.
- Linguistic codes, including code-switching and code-mixing, serve important social functions.
- Speech communities are defined by shared linguistic norms and characteristics.

### Essential Questions:

Learners will keep considering...

- How does our social world shape the way we use language?
- What is the difference between a "language" and a "dialect," and who gets to decide?
- Why do people switch between languages or styles in conversation, and what does it reveal about their identity and the social context?
- How do the unwritten rules of our communities influence our language choices and our perceptions of others?

### Acquisition

### _Learners will know…_

- The definition of sociolinguistics.
- Key terms: language, dialect, variety, accent, idiolect.
- Definitions of code, code-switching, and code-mixing.
- The concept and characteristics of a "speech community."
- Major figures and foundational principles in the field (e.g., concepts from Holmes, Wardhaugh, Yule).

### _Students will be skilled at…_

- Analyzing the interplay of social factors and language use in teaching contexts.
- Differentiating among various varieties of English.
- Identifying and interpreting patterns of code-switching and code-mixing.
- Recognizing the linguistic norms of various speech communities relevant to education.

# Stage 2 - Assessment Evidence

## Performance Tasks:

**Classroom Scenario Analysis:** Students will be given a detailed case study of a real-world multilingual/multidialectal English language classroom. The scenario will involve learners from different linguistic backgrounds, instances of code-switching between L1 and English, and potential conflicts arising from different speech community norms (e.g., norms for participation, politeness).

- **Goal:** Your goal is to act as a linguistic consultant for the teacher in the scenario.
- **Role:** You are a sociolinguistic analyst and pedagogical coach.
- **Audience:** The classroom teacher who needs practical advice.
- **Situation:** You need to analyze the linguistic behaviors in the classroom and provide a report.
- **Performance:** You will write a short report (2-3 pages) that:

1. Identifies the different languages, dialects, or varieties present.
2. Analyzes at least one instance of code-switching, explaining its probable social function.
3. Describes the different speech communities potentially at play and how their norms might be influencing classroom dynamics.
4. Proposes 2-3 concrete, reflective, and pluralistic strategies the teacher can use to support all learners effectively, referencing key concepts from the unit.

**Standards:**

The report will be evaluated on the accurate application of sociolinguistic terms, the depth of analysis, and the practicality and appropriateness of the pedagogical suggestions.

## Other Evidence:

- **Weekly Quizzes:** Short quizzes to check comprehension of key terms and concepts from the readings (e.g., language vs. dialect, code-mixing).
- **Think-Pair-Share Activities:** Informal assessment of understanding during in-class discussions on readings and case studies.
- **Exit Tickets:** Brief written responses at the end of a class to questions like, "What is the most important reason to understand code-switching as a teacher?"
- **Observation & Analysis:** A small homework task where students observe and briefly analyze an instance of language variation or code-switching they encounter in media or their community.

# Stage 3 - Learning Plan

[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/2204b19081c2806d8ee4d8afe7127571?pvs=21)

## Learning Plan Points

**Week 1: Introduction to Sociolinguistics**

- **W:** Introduce the unit goals, essential questions, and the final performance task. Explain _why_ understanding the link between language and society is fundamental for any language teacher.
- **H:** Hook students with the PBS video "Do You Speak American?" or by asking them to reflect on their own accents and dialects and where they come from.
- **E:** Equip students with the core definition of sociolinguistics. Through a mix of lecture and discussion, explore the relationship between language and society using Holmes (2022) as a guide. Students will _experience_ analyzing this relationship through initial, simple examples.
- **R:** Students will _rethink_ their preconceived notions of "correct" language through a guided discussion.
- **E:** Evaluate initial understanding with a quick poll or a simple exit ticket asking them to define sociolinguistics in their own words.
- **T:** Tailor instruction by bringing in examples relevant to the local context of Aguascalientes and Mexico.
- **O:** Organize the learning by introducing the key themes for the coming weeks: variation, codes, and communities.

**Week 2: Languages, Dialects, and Varieties**

- **W:** Revisit the unit goals and focus on the essential question: "What is the difference between a 'language' and a 'dialect,' and who gets to decide?"
- **H:** Play audio clips of different English dialects from around the world and ask students to identify where they think the speakers are from.
- **E:** Equip students with the terminology to distinguish between language, dialect, and variety using Wardhaugh (2015) and Yule (2006). Students will work in groups to analyze short texts or scenarios and apply the correct terms.
- **R:** Facilitate a debate using the prompt: "A language is a dialect with an army and a navy." Have students _refine_ their understanding of the role of power and prestige in defining language.
- **E:** A short quiz where students must identify and justify whether a described linguistic system is a language, dialect, or variety.
- **T:** Allow students to choose a specific variety of English (e.g., Indian English, Chicano English, Singaporean English) for a brief, informal presentation to the class.
- **O:** Structure activities to build from definitions to analysis, preparing them for more complex topics.

**Week 3: Linguistic Codes: Code-Switching & Code-Mixing**

- **W:** Frame the week's learning around the importance of understanding code-switching in bilingual/multilingual students.
- **H:** Show a clip from a TV show, movie, or interview where a speaker fluently code-switches. Ask students: "Why are they doing this? What purpose does it serve?"
- **E:** Equip students with the concepts of code-switching and code-mixing (Anisya & Syafryadin, 2018). Students will _experience_ identifying these phenomena in transcripts of conversations.
- **R:** Have students _reflect_ on their own code-switching habits (e.g., between English and Spanish) and discuss the social reasons for it in small groups.
- **E:** For a weekly task, have students (with consent) record and briefly transcribe a 1-minute conversation from their lives that features code-switching and write a short paragraph analyzing its function.
- **T:** Use examples of code-switching that are culturally relevant to the students.
- **O:** Organize the class to ensure students understand the _what_ (definitions) before moving to the _why_ (social functions). Preview the final topic: speech communities.

**Week 4: Speech Communities & Unit Synthesis**

- **W:** Explain that understanding speech communities helps tie all the previous concepts together and is key to creating an inclusive classroom. Re-emphasize the connection to the final performance task.
- **H:** Present a scenario of a communication breakdown between a teacher and a student due to differing speech community norms (e.g., directness vs. indirectness).
- **E:** Equip students with the definition and characteristics of a speech community. Students will work in groups to define the linguistic norms of a community they belong to (e.g., their group of friends, a family, an online gaming community).
- **R:** Have students _revisit_ the scenarios from the beginning of the unit and analyze them now through the lens of speech community theory.
- **E:** The main performance task (Classroom Scenario Analysis) is due. This is the summative _evaluation_ for the unit.
- **T:** Provide a choice of 2-3 different classroom scenarios for the performance task to cater to varied interests.
- **O:** Conclude the unit with a full-class discussion, synthesizing how the concepts of variety, codes, and community are interconnected. Provide a clear preview of Unit 2: Language Variation and Change.# Sociolinguistics Unit I: Foundations of Sociolinguistics
