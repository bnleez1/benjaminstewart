### **Chapter 2: Our Family, Our World**
### **A Note for the Teacher Trainer**
This second module continues to model the pedagogical principles of the _Lectura I_ syllabus, shifting the thematic focus to "Family." The structure remains transparent, allowing your teacher learners to simultaneously participate as language students and observe as future educators. This chapter emphasizes the reading skills of obtaining general and specific information and using context for vocabulary—core competencies for the A2+ level. Encourage your learners to reflect on how different family structures can be used as rich content for language teaching.

### **Module 2: Purpose & Desired Results**
**Essential Question:** How do different family structures shape who we are and how we relate to others?
**Purpose:** The purpose of this module is to apply your reading strategies to understand texts about families and relationships. Family is a universal topic, and being able to read and talk about it is essential for making deeper personal connections. We will practice extracting different layers of information from a text and build our vocabulary for describing the people closest to us.
**Desired Results:** By the end of this five-day module, you will be able to:
- Obtain general information to understand the overall structure and dynamic of a family described in a text.
- Scan a text to find specific information about family members, such as their roles and relationships.
- Identify the meaning of new vocabulary related to family by using clues from the surrounding context.
- Use key grammar and vocabulary, including possessives and descriptive adjectives, to talk about family structures.

### **Reading: A Portrait of Modern Families**
What does the word "family" mean to you? For many people, it means a mother, a father, and children. For others, it includes grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins living together. And for some, family can be one parent and a child, or a couple with beloved pets. Families around the world are diverse and beautiful in many ways, and reading about them requires an openness to different cultural and social contexts.
In this lesson, we will read about a few different families. As active participants in your learning, you will practice two important reading skills. First, we will practice getting **general information**, which is like looking at a photograph from a distance to see the whole picture. Then, we will find **specific information**, like using a magnifying glass to see the small, important details. Let's begin.
**The Rossi Family: A Nuclear Family in Florence**
The Rossi family lives in a small apartment in Florence, Italy. They are a **nuclear family**, which typically means two parents and their children. Paolo, the father, is a chef at a local restaurant. His wife, Sofia, is a part-time language tutor. They have two children. Their son, Leo, is ten years old, and their daughter, Mia, is seven. Paolo works long hours, so he is often tired, but he always makes time for his family on Sundays. On that day, they usually go to the park or visit the children's grandparents, who live in another city. Sofia is very organized and manages the busy **household**. She helps the children with their homework and makes sure everyone is happy and healthy. The children have a close relationship. Leo is protective of his younger sister, and Mia looks up to her big brother.
**Dialogue 1**
Mia’s Friend: Mia, is this a picture of your family?
Mia: Yes! This is my father, Paolo, and this is my mother, Sofia.
Mia’s Friend: And who is this boy?
Mia: That's my brother, Leo. His hair is very long in this picture! And that’s me!
Mia’s Friend: You have a nice family.
By reading this short text, you can get the general information that the Rossis are a small, busy, and loving family living in Italy. That’s the big picture.
**The Garcia Family: An Extended Family in Oaxaca**
In Oaxaca, Mexico, the Garcia family home is always full of life. They live as an **extended family**, meaning multiple generations live together. The head of the family is the grandmother, Elena. Her husband passed away, but she lives with her son, Carlos, his wife, Rosa, and their three children: Isabel, Mateo, and Luna. But that's not all. Carlos’s younger brother, Javier, who is not married, also lives with them in the same house. Elena is a fantastic cook and tells the best stories. Carlos and Rosa both work—he is a carpenter, and she is a market vendor. Uncle Javier is a musician. The cousins grow up like **siblings**, always playing together. In the Garcia family, everyone helps everyone. If someone has a problem, the entire family offers a supportive network to solve it.
Now, let's practice finding specific information. If you want to know "What is Uncle Javier's job?", you don't need to re-read everything. You can scan the text just for the name "Javier" and the word "job" or "work." You would quickly find the sentence: "Uncle Javier is a musician." This skill helps you find answers quickly.
**Dialogue 2**
Isabel's Classmate: You have a big family, don't you, Isabel?
Isabel: Yes, I do. My grandparents, my parents, my uncle, and my brother and sister all live with us.
Isabel's Classmate: Wow! Have you got your own room?
Isabel: No, I haven't. I share a room with my sister, Luna. But it's fun. We always talk before we go to sleep.
**Mr. Chen and Mei: A Single-Parent Family**
In a quiet neighborhood in Singapore lives Mr. Chen and his twelve-year-old daughter, Mei. Mr. Chen is a single parent. His wife died when Mei was very young, so he has raised her on his own. He works as a bus driver, which means he sometimes has to work very early in the morning or late at night. Because of this, Mei is a very independent and **responsible** girl. She helps with chores like washing the dishes and keeping her room tidy. They don't have a big family, but their bond is incredibly strong. Every Friday night is their special "movie night," where they order pizza and watch a film together. Mr. Chen's main goal is to provide a good education and a happy life for his daughter.
Sometimes, when you read, you must identify the meaning of vocabulary through context. Look at the word **responsible**. The text says Mei helps with chores because her father works long hours. From this context, you can infer that "responsible" means she is reliable and does the things she needs to do.
**Dialogue 3**
Mei’s Teacher: Mr. Chen, thank you for coming. I wanted to talk about Mei's progress.
Mr. Chen: Is everything okay?
Mei’s Teacher: Everything is wonderful. She is an excellent student. Because she is an only child, she is very focused. But I also notice she is very mature for her age.
Mr. Chen: Yes, she has to be. I am a single parent, so we are a team. We depend on each other.
Mei’s Teacher: It is clear you have a very special relationship.
These stories show us that families are defined by love and support, not just by their size or structure. Whether nuclear, extended, or single-parent, the family is the first community we belong to. By using reading strategies to understand their stories, we can better understand the world.
