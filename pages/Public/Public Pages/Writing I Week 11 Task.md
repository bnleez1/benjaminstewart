- After each question, designate the order in which you plan to answer each question in a coherent and cohesive paragraph by using numbers one through six.
- According to the questions, create a coherent and cohesive paragraph with a beginning (topic sentence), middle (details), and end (summary or conclusion) that has at least six sentences with at least 130 words, written in your shared Word document in Teams.
