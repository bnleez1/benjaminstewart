- Working in the [same teams as last week](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:SMcjTyltnAN3bVCMASbBwelMkMjDG5aagO67GiRcICc1@thread.tacv2/1715097604730?tenantId=e1e2e292-21d6-4849-b710-4d47d9578ad0&groupId=3ec11f48-aa41-4a81-af6c-6b62a50197c6&parentMessageId=1715097604730&teamName=Writing%20II&channelName=General&createdTime=1715097604730), complete rebuttal paragraph from last Tuesday.
- **Instructions**
    - One a clean sheet a paper, add your name and today's date.
    - Write down your team members and a assign a number, two to four.
    - Avoiding any cell phones or other devices and rely on each other to help with grammar and vocabulary, begin writing your topic sentence as a rebuttal according to the same topic you chose last week.
    - The topic sentence should begin with the main clause (with no linking verb), should have a noun phrase as the subject, and should be a complex sentence.
    - Show me your topic sentence before passing your paper to a classmate.
    - Once you have received feedback from me, pass your paper to a team mate and have them continue writing an evidence sentence that is not a simple sentence - make sure to write one paragraph _without_ beginning a sentence on a new line for each sentence.
    - Help each other develop your sentences and to check each other's work.
    - Continue passing around your paper for that each of your four sentences comes from a different team mate. Again, avoid any simple sentences.
    - Write the number in parenthesis to indicate which team mate wrote which sentence.
    - Remember that the two evidence sentences should provide examples, details, or facts related to the topic sentence.
    - The fourth sentence should be an analysis sentence that connects the evidence to the topic sentence and should be either a complex, compound, or complex-compound sentence.
    - Example
        - Rebuttal: Homeschooling can isolate children and may not provide a balanced education.
        - Example 1: Homeschooling, which requires a significant commitment from parents to ensure socialization and a comprehensive curriculum, offers a tailored educational experience that addresses specific learning needs of the student. Parents who understand their children better than most can differentiate the content based on what their children enjoy. They can also design learning experiences that give students the opportunity to explore their learning preferences such as kinestic and visual learning. Homeschooling allows parents to provide more flexibility and learning autonomy for their children by having more control over the learning experiences of their children.
        - Example 2: Homeschooling, which requires a significant commitment from parents to ensure socialization and a comprehensive curriculum, offers a tailored educational experience that addresses specific learning needs of the student. Parents who understand their children better than most can differentiate the content based on what their children enjoy. Differentiation of the learning experience is also possible by giving students the opportunity to explore their learning preferences such as kinestic and visual learning. Homeschooling allows parents to provide more flexibility and learning autonomy for their children by having more control over the learning experiences of their children.

> May 14, 2024, we’ll practice paraphrasing claims, counterclaims, and rebuttals using only parenthetical citations (see [[Parenthetical Vs. Narrative Citations]]).
## Example 1
**Instructions**: In the same teams from yesterday, assign team members to one of the claims from example one to paraphrase using a parenthetical citation. When paraphrasing someone else’s idea, try to avoid mentioning the study or authors but do include the citation listed in the example.
**Main Claim:**
- "Research indicates a significant correlation between regular physical activity and improved cardiovascular health, with studies showing a reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (Warburton et al., 2006)."
- **Paraphrased**: Regular exercise at the gym improves cardiovascular health by reducing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (Warburton et al., 2006).
**Counterclaim:**
- "While exercise is often promoted for its health benefits, some studies suggest that excessive exercise can have detrimental effects, such as increased risk of injuries, hormonal imbalances, and compromised immune function (O'Connor et al., 2019)."
- **Paraphrased**: Even though exercise is healthy, exercising too much can have harmful effects on the body: increased risk of injuries, hormonal imbalances, and compromised immune function (O’Connor et al., 2019).
**Rebuttal:**
- "Although excessive exercise can pose risks, moderate-intensity exercise, as recommended by health organizations (World Health Organization, 2020), is generally safe and provides numerous physical and mental health benefits."
- **Paraphrased**: If students do not overdo exercising, moderation lead to improved physical and mental benefits (O’Connor et al., 2019).
**In this example:**
- The evidence supporting the main claim cites a meta-analysis that demonstrates the positive effects of exercise on cardiovascular health.
- The counterclaim acknowledges potential negative effects of excessive exercise, supported by a relevant study.
- The rebuttal refutes the counterclaim by clarifying the distinction between moderate and excessive exercise, referencing guidelines from a reputable organization.

## Example 2
**Instructions**: In the same teams from yesterday, assign team members to one of the claims from example one to paraphrase using a parenthetical citation. When paraphrasing someone else’s idea, try to avoid mentioning the study or authors but do include the citation listed in the example.
**Main Claim:**
"The implementation of universal basic income (UBI) has the potential to reduce poverty and inequality, as evidenced by pilot studies in various countries showing increased financial stability and well-being among participants (Forget, 2021; Hoynes & Rothstein, 2019)."
**Counterclaim:**
"Critics argue that UBI may disincentivize work and lead to increased government spending, potentially burdening taxpayers and creating economic instability (Martinelli, 2017)."
**Rebuttal:**
"However, evidence from UBI experiments suggests minimal negative effects on work participation (Tcherneva, 2020), and the long-term economic benefits of reduced poverty and increased consumer spending may outweigh the initial costs (Standing, 2017)."
**In this example:**
- The main claim advocates for UBI as a solution to poverty and inequality, citing evidence from pilot studies.
- The counterclaim raises concerns about potential negative economic impacts, supported by research.
- The rebuttal addresses these concerns with evidence suggesting minimal work disincentives and potential long-term economic benefits.
## Example 3
**Instructions**: In the same teams from yesterday, assign team members to one of the claims from example one to paraphrase using a parenthetical citation. When paraphrasing someone else’s idea, try to avoid mentioning the study or authors but do include the citation listed in the example.
**Main Claim:**
"The legalization of marijuana has been shown to reduce crime rates related to drug-related offenses, as evidenced by decreases in arrests and convictions in states that have legalized the drug (Caulkins et al., 2012)."
**Counterclaim:**
"Opponents of legalization argue that it can lead to increased marijuana use, particularly among adolescents, potentially leading to negative health and societal consequences (Volkow et al., 2014)."
**Rebuttal:**
"However, studies examining the impact of legalization on adolescent marijuana use have found mixed results, with some showing no significant increase or even a decrease in use (Schuermeyer et al., 2018)."
**In this example:**
- The main claim focuses on the positive effect of marijuana legalization on crime rates, citing a relevant study.
- The counterclaim raises concerns about increased marijuana use among adolescents, supported by research.
- The rebuttal challenges the counterclaim by citing studies that show mixed results on adolescent marijuana use after legalization.
