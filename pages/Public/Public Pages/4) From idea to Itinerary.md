_A Module on the Language of Planning Future Travel_
---
### **Stage 1: Desired Results**
This module explores the dynamic process of planning travel, treating it as a communicative journey that moves from abstract dreams to concrete arrangements. We will focus on the specific linguistic tools learners need to navigate this process, ensuring they can clearly communicate intentions, possibilities, and confirmed plans in any travel scenario.
**Established Goals**
- Learners will be able to plan and discuss travel effectively by using appropriate language for different stages of the planning process.
**Enduring Understanding**
- Students will understand that planning and discussing travel effectively involves using appropriate linguistic tools to clearly communicate intentions, arrangements, and possibilities in diverse travel scenarios.
    
    **Essential Questions**
    
- How does our language change as a vague travel idea becomes a definite plan?
- What is the difference between deciding to do something at the moment of speaking versus talking about a pre-existing plan? How does our grammar show this?
- Why is linguistic precision critical when coordinating travel with other people?
- How do we use language to move a trip from a dream to a reality?
### **Stage 2: The Reading**
### **From Idea to Itinerary: The Language of Planning Future Travel**
The dream of a future trip begins as an abstract idea, a delightful possibility. As the dream gets closer to reality, it transforms into a concrete plan, complete with bookings, dates, and destinations. This progression from idea to itinerary is not just a logistical process; it is a communicative one, mapped out with specific linguistic tools. For English learners, understanding which tool to use at which stage is essential for clarity. Whether you are making a spontaneous decision, stating a long-held intention, or confirming a final arrangement, your choice of future tense signals exactly where you are in the planning journey. Mastering these tools is the key to navigating diverse travel scenarios successfully and ensuring everyone involved shares the same understanding.
**The Grammar of the Future: Intentions vs. Spontaneous Decisions**
In English, the two most common ways to express the future are with
**will** and **be going to**. 7 While they can sometimes seem interchangeable, they carry distinct meanings related to the speaker's mindset at the moment of communication.
We use **be going to** to talk about plans and intentions that were decided _before_ the conversation began. It signals premeditation. When you say, “We **are going to** visit Oaxaca next summer,” you are reporting a plan that already exists. The decision has been made, and now you are communicating it.
Conversely, we use **will** for decisions made spontaneously, _at the moment of speaking_. It is the language of sudden ideas, offers, and promises. If a friend says, “I’d love to see photos of your last trip,” you might respond, “Great, I’**ll** send you the link right now.” The decision to send the link was made in that instant.
Consider this conversation between friends:
Layla: I’m so ready for a vacation. I need to get away from the city.
Omar: I know what you mean. Look at this article about hiking in Patagonia. It looks incredible.
Layla: Wow. You know, I’m going to take a long hiking trip after I graduate next year. I’ve already started saving money for proper hiking gear.
Omar: That’s a fantastic plan! I don’t have any trips planned, but this article is inspiring. You know what? I’ll check flights to Argentina tonight, just for fun.
Layla’s statement, “I’m going to take,” expresses a pre-existing intention. Omar’s response, “I’ll check,” is a spontaneous decision made in that moment. Layla's use of specific
**travel vocabulary** like "hiking gear" adds to the sense that her plan is well-developed. 8
**The Theory of Action: The Power of a Speech Act**
This grammatical distinction is best understood through the lens of Speech Act Theory, which posits that when we use language, we are also performing actions (Austin, 1962). When you say, "I promise..." or "I warn you...", you are performing the acts of promising and warning.
Applying this to travel, stating “We **are going to fly** to Cancun on the 10th” is more than just a statement; it is a commissive speech act. It communicates a firm intention and commits the speaker to a course of action (Searle, 1969). It tells the listener, "You can count on this." In contrast, saying “Maybe I’**ll go** to the beach this weekend” is more of an expressive speech act; it conveys a feeling or a possibility with a much lower level of commitment. Understanding that your words perform actions helps clarify why choosing the right future form is so important for managing expectations.
**The Collaborative Itinerary: Using Language for Clear Planning**
This clarity becomes crucial when planning travel with others. Using the correct linguistic tools prevents misunderstandings about how firm a plan is. If you say, “I’ll book the hotel,” your partner understands it as a spontaneous offer. If you say, “I’m going to book the hotel this afternoon,” they understand it as a confirmed plan of action.
Priya: Okay, let’s finalize our weekend trip. I looked up the train schedule. I am going to buy our round-trip tickets online after this meeting.
Daniel: Perfect. I saw a guesthouse near the city center that has great reviews. It’s available. I'll make the reservation right now while we’re talking.
Priya: Great! What about Saturday activities?
Daniel: We are going to visit the main museum in the morning—I’ve already checked the opening times. For the afternoon, we could wander around the old market. I’m sure we’ll find something interesting there.
In this dialogue, Priya and Daniel expertly navigate the planning process. They use **be going to** for the actions they have already decided on (buying tickets, visiting the museum) and **will** for spontaneous offers ("I'll make the reservation") and general predictions ("we'll find something interesting"). This precise use of language ensures they are perfectly synchronized, transforming their shared ideas into a concrete, actionable itinerary.
