- Tip: To say what others have said, say, “Juan says that he likes to go fishing”. “Maria said that she enjoys listening to music”. You can use the present tense (Juan says…) or the past tense (Maria said…), but I would be consistent. Chose one verb tense and stick to it.
Here are some example paragraphs that have been reworded and elaborated on. Compare what you have with the examples below.

### Example 1
Yesterday marked a day of deeper connection for our protagonist. As she spent time with her classmates, she discovered shared passions and interests. A spark ignited between her and Caro, both finding joy in the world of books. A mutual love for dogs bridged the gap between her and Zully, their canine companions becoming a topic of lively conversation. While she yearned for more furry friends, her mom remained unconvinced. Vale works a part-time job on the weekends that demonstrates her industrious nature. Alondra recently went to the movies: she saw the Deadpool and Wolverine film. Jaqueline's unique hobby of Folk Dance, and she enjoys rhythm and expression in the art of Arabic Dance. A tapestry of personalities unfolded, weaving a vibrant picture of her classmates' lives and dreams.
### Example 2
Sombra is a young woman with a gentle spirit and an undeniable love for all creatures. One day, she noticed her friend Cristopher sporting a vibrant blue shirt. When I ask her about it, he said he liked the color and has other clothes with the same color. Meanwhile, Carlos, an avid swimmer, said he wants to spend more time swimming. Although he does not have a lot of time to swim, he dreams of swimming more frequently. Evelyn, on the other hand, loves to listen to music. Pop tunes are her favorite, but her heart belongs to the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. In fact, she celebrated her fourth birthday party with his great music and famous dance moves that shows her admiration for the artist.
### Example 3
Yesterday was a day of wonderful conversations. Paola is a proud pet owner who shared stories about her Rottweiler, Nami. Nami is a medium size playful puppy and is eight or nine months old. Her puppy brings a lot of joy to Paola's life. Meanwhile, Cristopher is not a frequent gamer and says that he likes Smash Bros. on his free time. Diana is an athlete and expresses a passion for swimming that she started three months ago. Sofía is a multi-talented musician who not only plays the drums but also plays the keyboards and ukulele. Finally, Carlos had an unexpected encounter with the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Carlos met the president while purchasing a Bon Ice.
