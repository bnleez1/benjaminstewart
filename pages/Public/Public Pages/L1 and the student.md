The text discusses the attitudes of language learners towards the use of their first language (L1) in English language classrooms. Surveys indicate that a majority of learners, both adults and younger students, approve of some L1 use, particularly among lower-level students. This preference for L1 use is also evident in the success of online language learning programs like Duolingo, which incorporate translation exercises.
To assess student preferences regarding L1 use, the text suggests using a questionnaire that covers various scenarios where L1 might be used (refer to [[Questionnaire using the L1 in the classroom]] and questionnaire section below). This questionnaire can help teachers and schools gather valuable information about students' attitudes and serve as a basis for discussions on class policies regarding L1 use. It can also help students become more aware of their learning preferences and strategies.
The text highlights the importance of understanding students' attitudes towards L1 use, including input from parents of younger learners and companies sponsoring professional English courses. Additionally, it discusses a research project by Hall & Cook (2013) that found common uses of L1 among students, such as consulting bilingual word lists, comparing grammar, and watching English videos with L1 subtitles. These activities can aid language acquisition.
Furthermore, the text acknowledges that students may use L1 for off-task reasons, such as chatting about unrelated topics. This behavior, often observed in older primary and lower secondary school students, can be a way for students to explore their identities and limit potential embarrassment when speaking English. The text suggests that some tolerance of L1 use may be necessary to create a safe and encouraging environment for language learners.
