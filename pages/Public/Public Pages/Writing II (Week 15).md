    ## Writing a thesis statement for an argumentative essay

    > [[Thesis statement and skeleton outline]].
    
    **Purpose of a Thesis Statement**
    
    The thesis statement is the heart of your argumentative essay. It:
    
    - **States Your Claim:** Clearly expresses your stance on the issue you're discussing.
    - **Previews Your Main Points:** Briefly outlines the key reasons or evidence you'll use to support your claim.
    - **Guides Your Essay:** Acts as a roadmap for your essay's structure and content.
    
    **Crafting a Strong Thesis Statement**
    
    1. **Take a Clear Position:** Avoid vague language. Make a definitive statement about your stance.
    2. **Be Specific:** Narrow down your focus to a specific aspect of the issue.
    3. **Make it Debatable:** Your thesis should be something that reasonable people could disagree with.
    4. **Provide a Roadmap:** Hint at the main points you'll use to support your argument.
    
    **10 Examples of Thesis Statements**
    
    1. **Environment:** While renewable energy sources offer a promising solution to climate change, their implementation requires substantial investment in infrastructure and technological advancements.
    2. **Technology:** Social media platforms have revolutionized communication, but their potential for cyberbullying and misinformation necessitates stricter regulation.
    3. **Education:** Standardized testing should be replaced with more holistic assessments that evaluate students' critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
    4. **Healthcare:** Universal healthcare is a moral imperative that would improve public health outcomes, reduce healthcare disparities, and boost economic productivity.
    5. **Economy:** A progressive tax system reduces income inequality, funding public services, and fosters a more equitable society.
    6. **Politics:** Campaign finance reform limits the influence of money in politics and ensures that all voices are heard in the democratic process.
    7. **Culture:** Cultural appropriation perpetuates stereotypes, erases cultural identities, and disrespects marginalized communities.
    8. **Ethics:** Gene editing technologies hold immense potential for treating genetic diseases, but their use raises ethical concerns about unintended consequences and designer babies.
    9. **Social Justice:** Affirmative action policies addresses historical discrimination, promotes diversity, and creates a more equitable society.
    10. **History:** The legacy of colonialism continues to shape global power dynamics, economic inequalities, and cultural identities.
    
    **Remember:**
    
    - **Tailor your thesis to your specific topic and the scope of your essay.**
    - **Revise your thesis as you research and write to ensure it accurately reflects your evolving argument.**
    
- Find an online source (article, etc.) to support any evidence sentences. Include the reference at the end of your essay (above from any images) and include a parenthetical paraphrased version of the reference. Select the evidence sentence and add a comment with the direct quote.
