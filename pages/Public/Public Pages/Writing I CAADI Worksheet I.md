> [!important] Schedule in CAADI and submit to the virtual classroom.
## Instructions
Each of the five CAADI worksheets for Writing I will require that you schedule time with a CAADI tutor for completing a written activity (i.e., a paragraph). The paragraph that you create during this activity will be the basis for completing your Grammar I CAADI worksheet (i.e., an analysis of form, meaning, and use).
# Task
- Complete the paragraph as instructor by CAADI tutor.
- Upload your one paragraph as a PDF to [Teams assignment](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/66aeee93-507d-479a-a3ef-8f494af43945/classroom?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22version%5C%22%3A%5C%221.0%5C%22%2C%5C%22config%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22classes%5C%22%3A%5B%7B%5C%22id%5C%22%3A%5C%22bdcacce9-d67b-4e01-b7d8-e7ca2bab99fe%5C%22%2C%5C%22assignmentIds%5C%22%3A%5B%5C%22d546489d-4385-4459-b1f1-08edfc7eeb72%5C%22%5D%7D%5D%7D%2C%5C%22action%5C%22%3A%5C%22navigate%5C%22%2C%5C%22view%5C%22%3A%5C%22assignment-viewer%5C%22%2C%5C%22appId%5C%22%3A%5C%221fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264%5C%22%2C%5C%22deeplinkType%5C%22%3A4%7D%22%2C%22channelId%22%3Anull%7D).
