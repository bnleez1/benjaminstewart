# Learner expectations

> [!important] As we begin the semester, it's important that you have an opportunity to express your expectations you have of me, your instructor, and of the course itself. Knowing your expectations from the beginning of class helps me better prepare my instruction according to your needs, wants, and personal preferences. The online form found on this page is where I'll ask that you submit your expectations, which will remain confidential. However, I may share certain group results, so that I can clarify my understandings and offer group discussion around how your expectations as a learner meet my expectations as your instructor.
