> [!important] As we begin a new semester, it's important that you have an opportunity to express your expectations you have of me, your instructor, and of the course itself. Knowing your expectations from the beginning of class helps me better prepare my instruction according to your needs, wants, and personal preferences. The online form found on this page is where I'll ask that you submit your expectations, which will remain confidential. I will share group results, however, I will not share individual responses; that is, your responses will remain confidential.
## General format for answering the questionnaire

> [!important] The questions below are the types of information that you may include in the online question you’ll be asked to complete.
