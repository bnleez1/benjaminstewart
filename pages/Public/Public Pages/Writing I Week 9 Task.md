# Task
- On a clean sheet of paper with your name at the top, use the written prompt provided in class on October 10, 2024 to create a list of key words and phrases as details: what, how, why, when, where, with whom, etc. based on the following question: _==Describe your favorite season of the year. Explain why you enjoy it and how the weather during this season affects your daily life. Use specific examples to support your response.==_
- Below your list of words (brainstorm), create a coherent and cohesive paragraph with a topic sentence, details, and summary or conclusion sentence (five-to-eight sentences), 120-150 words.
- Take a picture of your completed paragraph and keywords and add it to your Word document in [https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/WritingI/EsdfBF30IAZLk_3Fu6331BsBkYs2tCKxUubXTCVMHRufAQ?e=shT9kO](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/WritingI/EsdfBF30IAZLk_3Fu6331BsBkYs2tCKxUubXTCVMHRufAQ?e=shT9kO).
- Review group feedback
    1. Bookmark [[Writing error code list]] and refer to it when reviewing your work.
    2. I enjoy reading, walking, etc. and not, _==I enjoy to read==_ or _==I enjoy read==_. See also [[Gerunds vs. infinitives- Unveiling the subtleties with the Bolinger Principle]].
    3. I like to walk or I like walking, but not, ==I like walk==.
    4. Do not use grammar checker, translation software, or any other GenAI service.
    5. Review comma splices (CS): [[Avoiding the Comma Splice Trap (CS)]].
    6. Word word (WW) vs. Word choice (WC): Wrong words interfere with the meaning of the text while word choice does not interfere with meaning, but is nonstandard or awkward.
    7. WF: Word form refers to the incorrect part of speech of the same word. For example, “placed” instead of “place”, “quiet” instead of “quietly”, etc.
- Above your image, complete your final draft of your paragraph based on what you wrote on Thursday (October 10, 2024), _==making sure to review the assessment criteria listed below==_.
- Submit your work as a PDF to the [Teams assignment](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/66aeee93-507d-479a-a3ef-8f494af43945/classroom?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22version%5C%22%3A%5C%221.0%5C%22%2C%5C%22config%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22classes%5C%22%3A%5B%7B%5C%22id%5C%22%3A%5C%22bdcacce9-d67b-4e01-b7d8-e7ca2bab99fe%5C%22%2C%5C%22assignmentIds%5C%22%3A%5B%5C%22fbbf07c9-f996-4cfe-9652-44219bd10102%5C%22%5D%7D%5D%7D%2C%5C%22action%5C%22%3A%5C%22navigate%5C%22%2C%5C%22view%5C%22%3A%5C%22assignment-viewer%5C%22%2C%5C%22appId%5C%22%3A%5C%221fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264%5C%22%2C%5C%22deeplinkType%5C%22%3A4%7D%22%2C%22channelId%22%3Anull%7D).
