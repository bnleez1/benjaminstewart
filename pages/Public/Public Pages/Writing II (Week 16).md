- Based on your skeleton outline develop your second body paragraph (to support your counterclaim), following the [[../../../60 Public/50 Notes/Permanent Notes/The M.E.A.L. Plan- A Comprehensive Approach to Paragraph Development]]. You are encouraged to use the initial body paragraph you developed a couple of weeks ago with your classmates, making any changes you deem necessary.
- Replace any evidence sentences with actual examples, facts, statistics, or details found online from reliable text sources (i.e., avoid _.com_ websites, etc).
- Avoid any grammar checkers, translation software, or any GenAI text. An originality report will be generated once you have completed your first draft.
- Check each other’s work and assist each other as necessary.
- Receive feedback from me as needed (i.e., in class or outside of class).
- Generative AI prompting
    
    > [!important] Today we’ll discuss how you might use generative AI and how you should not use it for writing your argumentative essay.
    
    > [!important] Prompts 1-4 provide general ideas for understanding what an intial claim, counterclaim, and rebutall are, but are not necessarily well-written topic sentences. Well clarify this in class (e.g., beginning each topic sentence with the main clause, avoiding linking verbs in the main clause, etc.).
    
    - Prompt 1 (topic of climate change): _Create an initial claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal that would serve as topic sentences in an argumentative essay on the topic of climate change._
        
        **Initial claim:** The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries will inevitably lead to significant job displacement and economic inequality.
        
        **Counterclaim:** While AI may automate certain tasks, it will also create new job opportunities and ultimately boost economic growth.
        
        **Rebuttal:** The new jobs created by AI will likely require specialized skills and education, leaving many workers without the necessary qualifications behind and exacerbating existing economic disparities.
        
    - Prompt 2 (topic of animal rights in zoos): _Create an initial claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal that would serve as topic sentences in an argumentative essay on the topic of animal rights in zoos._
        
        **Initial claim**: Zoos inherently violate animal rights by confining them to artificial environments, depriving them of their natural habitats and social structures.
        
        **Counterclaim**: Zoos play a crucial role in wildlife conservation by protecting endangered species, educating the public, and supporting research efforts.
        
        **Rebuttal**: While zoos may contribute to conservation efforts, the ethical concerns of keeping animals in captivity for entertainment and profit outweigh any potential benefits.
        
    - Prompt 3 (fast fashion): _Create an initial claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal that would serve as topic sentences in an argumentative essay on the topic of fast fashion._
        
        **Initial claim**: The fast fashion industry perpetuates a cycle of excessive consumption and waste, contributing significantly to environmental degradation and resource depletion.
        
        **Counterclaim**: Fast fashion democratizes fashion by making trendy clothing affordable and accessible to a wider range of consumers.
        
        **Rebuttal**: While fast fashion may offer affordability, the environmental and social costs associated with its production practices ultimately outweigh any perceived benefits of increased access to trendy clothing.
        
    - Prompt 4 (animal rights): _Create an initial claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal that would serve as topic sentences in an argumentative essay on the topic of animal rights._
        
        **Initial claim:** Animals deserve the same fundamental rights as humans, including the right to life, freedom from suffering, and the right to live in their natural habitats.
        
        **Counterclaim:** Animals are fundamentally different from humans and lack the cognitive abilities and moral agency to warrant the same rights.
        
        **Rebuttal:** While animals may not possess the same cognitive abilities as humans, they are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain and suffering, and thus deserve protection and respect.
        
    - Prompt 5: _Create an initial claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal based on the following thesis statement designed for writing a five-paragraph argumentative essay:_ [add thesis statement here]
        
        > [!important] Notice that the improved versions of each claim (initial claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal) have the following: main clause comes first, avoids any linking verbs (e.g., to be, etc.), and simplifies some words or uses synonyms.
        
        **Thesis statement**: By destroying the ecosystems due to deforestation, human beings mainly affect the environment because it leads to climate change, and desertification.
        
        **Claim:** Deforestation is a primary driver of climate change, as it eliminates trees that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, disrupting the natural balance of greenhouse gases. **Improved**: Deforestation drives climate change by eliminating trees that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which disrupts the natural balance of greenhouse gases.
        
        **Counterclaim:** While deforestation contributes to carbon emissions, its impact on climate change is minimal compared to other factors, such as industrial processes and fossil fuel combustion. **Improved**: The effects on carbon emissions that result from deforestation do not compare to the more stressful factors such as industrial processes and fossil fuel combustion.
        
        **Rebuttal:** Although other factors contribute to climate change, the destruction of forests exacerbates the issue by reducing the planet's capacity to absorb excess carbon dioxide, further accelerating global warming and its devastating consequences. **Improved**: The destruction of forests worsens carbon emissions by reducing the planet’s capacity to absorb excess carbon dioxide, which further speeds up global warming and its devastating consequences.
