- Position yourselves in such a way so that everyone is heard while you record your entire session. Test your phones first to make sure you are getting a good recording and that it does not automatically shut off during the recording. I would use everyone’s phone to record, then use the best recording for transcribing the audio.
- ==Play the game, which may include reviewing the instructions of the game and the game itself, but should also include discussing hobbies and interests. Use the graphic organizer you completed yesterday to discuss not only your own hobbies and interests, but hobbies and interests related to your classmates from Monday and Tuesday of this week, and any family members from your household that you spoke with. Each team member should speak in English only and each team member should speak about the same amount of time. Make sure to encourage each team member to speak by asking questions.==
- Transcribe the audio recording of your 50-minute conversation in Word Online.
- Each team member should choose one of the templates to rename using your complete name, first name first: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hHwWqO3b0kqWnl-znY97smX0OnZSwMqW?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hHwWqO3b0kqWnl-znY97smX0OnZSwMqW?usp=sharing).
- Using the template, _each team member_ should calculate word counts either in Word or after you have copy-and-pasted transcription from Word to Google Drive. ==Alternative: For this assignment, if you would rather work only in Microsoft Word instead of Google Drive, that’s fine, but use the template provided in Google Drive when completing the assignment.==
- Once each team member has completed their word counts, compare each other’s numbers and determine which is the most accurate.
- Once you have reviewed the Assessment Checklist below, each teammate should upload their completed template as a PDF to the [virtual classroom assignment](https://aulavirtual.uaa.mx/mod/assign/view.php?id=150352) by August 23, 2024. Since we are moving to Microsoft Teams August 24, 2024, if you need to resubmit this assignment, upload it to the [Teams, Week 2 folder](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAEI/Et71kNipKPFLqp1-oqHNL-QBcl39MPMoedO5v_FAAEHDmw?e=urBgaM).
