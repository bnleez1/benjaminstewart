    - Reading 1 - The Whispering Reef
        
        To the human ear, a coral reef can seem deceptively quiet. Yet a healthy reef is anything but silent: it crackles and pops with the snaps of shrimp and the grunts of small fishes. Marine biologists now refer to this biological noise as a kind of _soundscape_. For organisms drifting in the open ocean—especially the larval stages of reef fishes—these sounds can function like a beacon, guiding the young back to suitable habitat after weeks of pelagic life.
        
        Experiments have shown that larvae placed in chambers with recordings of thriving reefs swim toward the speakers, while those exposed to recordings from degraded reefs show weaker responses. The implication is straightforward: quieter reefs may fail to recruit the very animals that help them recover. Restoration teams have begun placing underwater speakers at some sites to “seed” soundscapes during key settlement periods. The approach is hardly a cure‑all, but early trials suggest it can accelerate repopulation when paired with other efforts such as controlling fishing pressure and restoring coral cover.
        
        Sound is not the only cue larvae use. Chemical traces shed by algae and corals, as well as coastal currents and the dim patterns of moonlight near the surface, can also play a role. Nevertheless, the acoustic signature of a reef has a particular advantage: unlike chemical cues that diffuse quickly, sound can travel across hundreds of meters with relatively little loss of information. That makes a vibrant reef audible well before it is visible.
        
        **R1Q1 (Factual) — What attracts larvae?**
        
        Correct Answer: _The snapping of shrimp and the noises of small fishes._

        **R1Q9 (Inference) — Degraded reefs**
        
        Correct Answer: _Recordings from degraded reefs elicit weaker swimming responses because their soundscapes lack the cues larvae seek._
        
        **R1Q10 (Classification) — Which category?**
        
        Correct Answer: _Snapping-shrimp crackle recorded from a thriving reef._
        
    - Reading 2 - Paper Money in Song-Dynasty China
        
        During China’s Song dynasty (960–1279), merchants in several cities began using paper instruments in place of bulky bronze coins. These privately issued notes, called _jiaozi_, were originally receipts that certified a deposit of coin at a money‑changer’s shop. Because the notes could be transferred to settle debts, they soon circulated beyond the original depositors and became a convenient medium of exchange for long‑distance trade.
        
        As the scale of commerce grew, the government moved to regulate the practice. Authorities required that issuers maintain adequate reserves, standardized note design, and imposed expiration dates to limit overissue. Eventually, the state monopolized note production and created official paper currency backed by stores of coin and goods. Although counterfeiting and regional shortages of metal money occasionally undermined confidence, the system generally facilitated taxation and reduced the costs of moving wealth across great distances.
        
        The Song experience shows that money is as much about trust as about metal. A note had value because reputable merchants—and later the government—stood behind its redemption. The familiar logic of convertibility that underpinned early Chinese paper instruments would reappear centuries later, when banks in Europe issued promises to pay in specie on demand.
        
        **R2Q1 (Vocabulary) — 'receipts'**
        
        Correct Answer: _written acknowledgments of deposits._
        
        **R2Q2 (Factual) — Why notes spread**
        
        Correct Answer: _They could be transferred to settle debts, making them convenient for trade._
        
        **R2Q3 (Inference) — Government regulation**
        
        Correct Answer: _Officials wanted to stabilize the system and prevent overissue that might erode trust._
        
        **R2Q4 (Negative Factual) — NOT mentioned motivation**
        
        Correct Answer: _Banning the use of paper notes for tax payments._
        
        **R2Q5 (Vocabulary) — 'convertibility'**
        
        Correct Answer: _the ability to be exchanged for coin or specie._
        
        **R2Q6 (Sentence Simplification) — Essential meaning**
        
        Correct Answer: _Despite some problems, paper currency on the whole made taxing and transferring wealth easier and cheaper._
        
        **R2Q7 (Insert Text) — Best position**
        
        Correct Answer: _[D]_
        
        **R2Q8 (Factual) — Why valuable**
        
        Correct Answer: _Because reputable merchants or the government guaranteed redemption._
        
        **R2Q9 (Inference) — European banks**
        
        Correct Answer: _promised to pay the holder a specific amount of coin on demand._

    - Reading 3 - The Printing Press and Pamphlet Culture
        
        When movable‑type printing appeared in mid‑fifteenth‑century Europe, its most visible products were not massive books but small, quickly produced pamphlets. Cheap sheets, folded once or twice, could be printed overnight and carried by peddlers along trade routes that already knit towns together. Because pamphlets were brief and topical, they became a vehicle for everything from sensational news to practical advice and religious argument.
        
        Authorities worried about the social consequences of this new speed of communication. Some cities licensed presses and required prior approval for controversial works; others allowed publication first and punished printers later. In either case, censorship proved uneven. Copies slipped across borders, and reprints sprang up wherever sympathetic buyers could be found. Meanwhile, literacy was rising—slowly and unevenly—creating wider audiences without eliminating the need for public readings in marketplaces and churches.
        
        Pamphlet culture did not replace learned scholarship, but it changed the rhythm of public debate. Brief formats encouraged sharp claims and memorable slogans. The same features that helped ideas spread—low cost, portability, and speed—also made it difficult to ensure accuracy. Yet even critics acknowledged that the press created a new sense of simultaneity: people in distant towns could argue about the same text within days.
        
        **R3Q1 (Factual) — Why pamphlets spread**
        
        Correct Answer: _They were inexpensive and could be carried along existing trade routes._
        
        **R3Q2 (Vocabulary) — 'topical'**
        
        Correct Answer: _concerned with current events._
        
        **R3Q3 (Negative Factual) — NOT stated about censorship**
        
        Correct Answer: _Censorship prevented pamphlets from crossing political borders._
        
        **R3Q4 (Inference) — Public readings**
        
        Correct Answer: _They remained useful because literacy was increasing unevenly._
        
        **R3Q5 (Sentence Simplification) — Essential meaning**
        
        Correct Answer: _The qualities that allowed pamphlets to circulate widely also made them prone to errors._
        
        **R3Q6 (Insert Text) — Best position**
        
        Correct Answer: _[A]_
        
        **R3Q7 (Vocabulary) — 'simultaneity'**
        
        Correct Answer: _a condition of happening at the same time._
        
        **R3Q8 (Factual) — Rhythm of debate**
        
        Correct Answer: _favoring brief, memorable claims that circulated quickly._
        
        **R3Q9 (Inference) — Critics acknowledged**
        
        Correct Answer: _To show that the widespread, rapid circulation of texts was evident to supporters and opponents alike._
        
        **R3Q10 (Classification) — Which category?**
        
        Correct Answer: _Constraints on diffusion._

        # The Story: _My Ideal Roommate Experience_
        
        When I started university, I was nervous about living with a roommate. At home, I always had my own room, so sharing space with a stranger felt difficult. I worried: What if my roommate was noisy? What if they were messy? What if we didn’t get along? Still, I knew this experience could also be a chance to learn about friendship and community.
        
        On the first day, I met Daniel, my new roommate. He was tall, quiet, and smiled a lot. At first, we were both shy, but soon we started talking. He asked about my hometown and hobbies. I learned that he loved playing guitar, while I enjoyed reading and writing. Our hobbies were different, but we were curious about each other’s lives. That curiosity helped us begin a friendship.
        
        The first week, things were not perfect. Daniel liked to play his guitar in the evening, but I preferred to study quietly at that time. At first, I felt annoyed but didn’t say anything. Then I realized that silence would not solve the problem. I decided to talk to him. I said, “Daniel, I like your music, but it’s hard to concentrate on my homework when you play at night. Could you practice earlier in the afternoon?” He smiled and agreed right away. He said he didn’t know it bothered me and was happy to change. That moment showed me how important communication is when living with someone else. If I had stayed quiet, our friendship might have suffered. Instead, a short conversation solved the problem.
        
        Another challenge was cleaning. I am very organized, but Daniel didn’t mind leaving clothes on the floor or dishes in the sink. I became frustrated and thought, “Why should I always clean?” But then I remembered that compromise is necessary when sharing a room. I suggested we make a cleaning plan. We agreed that I would take out the trash and sweep the floor, while he would wash the dishes and organize the desk. The plan was not perfect, but it was fair. Soon our room looked better, and we both felt responsible. This taught me that compromise means balance, not giving up everything.
        
        Over time, Daniel and I found ways to enjoy our time together. We sometimes cooked pasta in the dorm kitchen or watched movies late at night. I even learned a few chords on his guitar, and he borrowed one of my favorite books. These small activities built a feeling of community. Our room no longer felt like “my side” and “his side.” It became _our_ space, where we felt comfortable and welcome.
        
        One day, another student in our dorm had a problem. His laptop broke, and he needed to finish an assignment. Without hesitation, Daniel offered his laptop. I realized then that an ideal roommate is not only someone who respects you but also someone who cares about others in the community. Daniel’s kindness reminded me that living in a shared space also means helping neighbors and friends.
        
        By the end of the semester, I thought back to my first fears: noise, mess, and conflict. All those worries were real, but they were also opportunities. Because Daniel and I learned to communicate and compromise, we turned problems into lessons. I learned to speak honestly but politely. I learned to share responsibilities fairly. I learned to accept differences and create shared traditions. Most of all, I learned that relationships with roommates can teach us patience, kindness, and understanding.
        
        Now, when people ask me about my ideal roommate, I always describe Daniel. He was not perfect—sometimes he was messy or loud—but he listened, respected me, and grew with me. An ideal roommate is not someone without problems. It is someone who works with you to solve them. Living with Daniel showed me that relationships are not only about sharing space; they are about sharing life.

        # The Story: _Living with Sofia_
        
        When I moved to the city for my first job, I needed to find a place to live. Rent was expensive, so I decided to share an apartment. Through a friend, I met Sofia, who was also looking for a roommate. She was friendly, with curly hair and a big laugh. At first, I worried about sharing space with a stranger, but I also felt excited to meet someone new.
        
        During the first days, we tried to get to know each other. Sofia asked about my work, and I asked about her studies. She was a university student who loved art, while I worked in an office and enjoyed sports. We were different in many ways, but we both wanted a peaceful home. That shared goal became our first step toward good communication.
        
        The first problem appeared after a week. Sofia liked to invite her friends over to paint and listen to music. I didn’t mind the music, but sometimes it was loud late at night, and I needed to wake up early for work. At first, I stayed silent, but I started to feel stressed and tired. Finally, I decided to talk with her. I said, “Sofia, I enjoy your friends and music, but could you finish earlier during the week? I need to sleep for work.” She listened carefully and agreed. She said she hadn’t realized the noise was a problem and promised to end the gatherings earlier on weekdays. I felt relieved. That simple talk showed me that expressing my needs politely was better than staying quiet.
        
        Another challenge was food. We both liked cooking, but our styles were different. I liked simple meals like pasta or chicken, while Sofia enjoyed cooking with many spices and vegetables. At first, we cooked separately, but this used more money and created a lot of dishes. One evening, I suggested we cook together twice a week. She agreed, and we started trying each other’s recipes. I learned how to make vegetable soup with her, and she learned to make roasted chicken with me. This compromise saved us money, reduced cleaning, and also made dinner a fun activity. Cooking together showed me that compromise can turn a problem into a positive experience.
        
        Over time, our differences helped us grow. I became more open to trying new foods, and she started to enjoy simple meals when she was busy. We also divided chores: I vacuumed and took out the trash, while she washed dishes and watered the plants. We didn’t always follow the schedule perfectly, but we reminded each other kindly. This sense of fairness made our apartment feel more like a community.
        
        One evening, there was a power outage in our neighborhood. The lights went out, and the refrigerator stopped working. At first, I felt nervous, but Sofia stayed calm. She brought candles, and we sat together in the living room. She suggested playing a board game, and we laughed for hours. The next day, we shared the remaining food with neighbors who also lost power. That night, I realized that an ideal roommate not only supports you inside the apartment but also helps build community with others.
        
        At the end of the year, I thought about everything I had learned. At first, I only wanted someone to share rent with, but living with Sofia taught me much more. I learned that good communication means speaking clearly but kindly. I learned that compromise is not losing, but finding a middle point where both people are satisfied. I learned that community is created by sharing time, meals, and even challenges.
        
        When people ask me now about my ideal roommate, I often describe Sofia. She was not perfect—sometimes she forgot to wash the dishes, and sometimes I forgot to vacuum—but we respected and supported each other. An ideal roommate is not someone who never makes mistakes. It is someone who is willing to listen, change, and work together. Living with Sofia showed me that relationships with roommates can make daily life easier, but more importantly, they can teach us how to be better friends and neighbors.

        # The Story: _Rooming with Javier_
        
        When I entered my second year of college, I moved into a small apartment near campus. I didn’t want to live alone because rent was high, so I looked for a roommate. Through a university notice board, I found Javier, an engineering student who also needed a place. We met at a café, and after a short talk, we decided to share the apartment. I felt nervous but also hopeful.
        
        At first, things went well. Javier was friendly, and we both wanted to save money. He enjoyed video games, while I enjoyed reading. We agreed that we could have our own hobbies, but we also wanted to build a home where we felt comfortable. This idea gave us a good start.
        
        The first challenge appeared during the second week. Javier liked to play his video games with friends online late at night, and he sometimes shouted when he was excited. The noise made it hard for me to sleep, especially when I had early classes. At first, I felt angry but kept quiet. After a few nights, I realized I needed to speak up. One morning, I told him, “Javier, I understand you like games, but it’s hard for me to rest when it’s noisy at midnight. Could you play earlier?” He looked surprised but said, “I didn’t know it bothered you. I’ll try to finish before 11 p.m.” From that day, he respected the new rule. This experience showed me how clear communication can solve conflicts before they grow bigger.
        
        A second challenge came with groceries. I bought food for myself, and so did Javier, but sometimes he ate my snacks or I used his milk without asking. We both felt frustrated. Instead of arguing, we sat down and talked. We decided to share some items, like bread, milk, and rice, and we each put money into a small jar every week for those. For personal snacks, we kept them separate. This compromise worked well, and soon food was no longer a problem. I learned that compromise does not mean losing—it means creating fair solutions.
        
        Another important moment happened with cleaning. I like things organized, but Javier didn’t care much about dust or dishes. At first, I cleaned everything myself, but I started to feel resentful. I finally said, “Let’s make a cleaning plan.” We created a schedule: he cleaned the bathroom, and I took care of the kitchen. We both vacuumed once a week. It wasn’t perfect—sometimes we forgot—but reminding each other kindly helped us stay on track. Sharing the chores made us feel equal, and our apartment became a healthier place.
        
        As time passed, Javier and I grew closer. We sometimes cooked together, mixing my simple recipes with his more complicated ones. We also watched movies on weekends and invited classmates to join. Slowly, our apartment became not just a place to sleep, but a small community. Friends felt welcome, and we felt proud of our home.
        
        One evening, a neighbor’s water pipe broke, and her kitchen flooded. Javier quickly helped her carry buckets of water outside, and I went to get towels. Together, we stayed until her kitchen was dry. That night, I realized that an ideal roommate is not only someone who respects you, but also someone who cares about the people around them. Javier’s willingness to help others taught me the value of kindness in a community.
        
        By the end of the year, I thought about everything I had learned. At the beginning, I only wanted someone to share rent with. In the end, I found much more. I learned that communication is the key to solving problems. I learned that compromise creates fairness and peace. I learned that living together builds community when people respect and support each other.
        
        Today, when people ask me about my ideal roommate, I describe Javier. He was not perfect—sometimes he forgot to clean or played games too long—but he listened, changed, and worked with me. That, to me, is what makes an ideal roommate. Living with him showed me that sharing space is not just practical; it is also a lesson about sharing life.

        # The Story: _Sharing a Room with Amina_
        
        When I started studying abroad, I moved into a student residence. I was excited, but I also felt nervous because I had never shared a room with someone outside my family. The residence assigned me a roommate named Amina. She came from another country, and I worried about how we would live together. I asked myself: What if our cultures were too different? What if our daily habits did not match?
        
        On the first day, Amina greeted me with a warm smile. She spoke English well, and she asked many questions about my family and my hometown. I learned that she was studying biology and enjoyed cooking. I told her that I studied business and liked sports. Even though our interests were different, we were both open to learning from each other. This first conversation helped us feel more comfortable.
        
        The first challenge came quickly. Amina liked to wake up early, around six in the morning. She played soft music while she got ready for class. I, however, preferred to sleep late and felt annoyed by the sound. At first, I did not say anything because I did not want to appear unfriendly. But after a few mornings, I felt too tired. One evening, I finally said, “Amina, I know you enjoy music in the morning, but it makes it hard for me to sleep. Could you use headphones?” She immediately agreed and apologized. From then on, she used earphones, and I was able to rest. That moment taught me that speaking politely and clearly can prevent small problems from becoming big ones.
        
        The second challenge was about cleaning. Amina was very neat, and she liked everything in its place. I was more relaxed and sometimes left my books or clothes on the chair. After a week, she asked me kindly if I could keep my things organized because the room was small. At first, I felt embarrassed, but I also understood her point. I decided to change my habits and clean more often. To help each other, we made a rule: every Saturday we would both spend 30 minutes cleaning the room together. This compromise worked, and our room stayed tidy. I learned that sometimes compromise means adjusting your behavior for the comfort of another person.
        
        Food was another area where we needed to cooperate. Since Amina loved cooking, she often used the shared kitchen. I usually bought simple meals or sandwiches. One day, she invited me to eat with her, and I discovered new dishes I had never tried before. In return, I introduced her to some of my favorite foods from home. Soon, we began cooking together once or twice a week. Cooking together not only saved us money but also created a sense of community. We shared recipes, stories, and laughter.
        
        Over time, our friendship grew stronger. We studied together in the evenings, and sometimes she helped me with science topics, while I helped her with business presentations. On weekends, we joined group activities in the residence. Because we were both friendly with others, our room became a place where classmates felt welcome.
        
        One special moment showed me the value of community. During exam week, one student on our floor became sick and could not attend the cafeteria. Amina suggested that we prepare soup and bring it to her. I agreed, and we spent the evening cooking and visiting the student. She was very thankful. I realized then that an ideal roommate is not only someone who shares space with you but also someone who helps build kindness in the larger community.
        
        At the end of the semester, I thought about everything I had learned. Living with Amina taught me that communication is the key to solving conflicts, that compromise makes life fairer, and that community grows when people help each other. I entered the residence looking for a place to sleep, but I left with a true friend and many important lessons.
        
        When people ask me what makes an ideal roommate, I describe Amina. She was not perfect—sometimes she cooked with strong spices that filled the whole room—but she listened, respected me, and cared for others. For me, that is what really matters. Living with her showed me that roommates are not just partners in rent; they are teachers of communication, compromise, and community.

        When I moved to the capital city for my first internship, I needed a roommate to share the rent. The apartment was too expensive for me alone, so I looked online and met Carlos, a law student. At first, I worried because I didn’t know him, but after a short meeting in a café, I decided to give it a try.
        
        The first days were easy. Carlos was kind and helpful. He even carried some of my boxes up the stairs on moving day. We both wanted the apartment to be a calm and safe place, so we agreed to respect each other’s routines. That simple agreement gave me hope that living together would be possible.
        
        Still, problems appeared quickly. Carlos enjoyed watching movies at night with the volume loud. I usually went to bed early because my internship started at 7 a.m. At first, I stayed silent, but after three nights I was too tired. One morning, I said, “Carlos, I like movies too, but it’s hard for me to sleep when the TV is loud after midnight. Could you use headphones?” He nodded and said, “I didn’t realize it was a problem. I’ll use them.” From that moment, the noise stopped. I understood that communication—speaking clearly but politely—is the only way to solve conflicts.
        
        Another challenge was cleaning. I liked a tidy kitchen, but Carlos often left dishes in the sink. I felt annoyed and thought about cleaning them myself, but I knew that wasn’t fair. One Saturday, I suggested, “Why don’t we make a cleaning schedule?” He agreed, and we wrote it down on a piece of paper: I cleaned the bathroom, and he took care of the kitchen. Every Sunday, we vacuumed together. The plan wasn’t perfect—sometimes one of us forgot—but it gave us a balance. That experience showed me that compromise doesn’t mean doing everything alone. It means sharing responsibility fairly.
        
        We also had to work out how to share food. At first, we bought our groceries separately, but sometimes I ate some of his bread, and he used my milk. This caused small arguments. One evening we talked and decided to share the basics: rice, bread, milk, and eggs. We each put money in a jar every week. For snacks, we kept them separate. This small compromise saved money, reduced conflict, and made shopping easier.
        
        Over time, our relationship grew stronger. We began to cook dinner together a few nights a week. Carlos taught me how to make tacos, and I showed him how to cook pasta with tomato sauce. We laughed a lot while cooking, and soon the kitchen became our favorite place in the apartment. These shared meals helped us build community, not only between us but also with neighbors, because we sometimes invited them to join.
        
        One evening, a neighbor’s electricity went out, and her apartment became very dark. Carlos quickly offered her some candles and invited her to eat with us. I admired how naturally he cared for others. That night, I realized that an ideal roommate is not only someone who respects you but also someone who helps create a friendly and supportive community around them.
        
        At the end of my internship, I looked back at my time with Carlos. In the beginning, I only wanted someone to share rent with, but I learned much more. I learned to speak honestly when something bothered me. I learned that compromise is necessary for peace in a shared space. I also learned that true community grows when people care for each other, not just themselves.
        
        Now, when people ask me about an ideal roommate, I describe Carlos. He wasn’t perfect—sometimes he forgot the cleaning schedule—but he was respectful, open to change, and kind to others. Living with him taught me that roommates are more than people who share an apartment. They are partners who teach us important lessons about communication, compromise, and community.

        # The Story: _Rooming with Elena_
        
        When I started my first year at university, I moved into a dormitory. I was both excited and worried because it was the first time I would live away from home. I didn’t know who my roommate would be, and I wondered: What if she was noisy? What if she was messy? What if we didn’t get along?
        
        On the first day, I met Elena, my new roommate. She had short hair, a kind face, and a very positive attitude. She introduced herself with a big smile and said, “I hope we can make this room feel like home.” Her words made me feel less nervous. We talked for a while and discovered that she liked painting, while I enjoyed writing. Even though our hobbies were different, we both wanted a quiet space to study and relax. That first conversation gave me hope.
        
        During the first week, we faced our first problem. Elena liked to talk on the phone with her family late at night. I wanted to sleep early, but her voice kept me awake. At first, I tried to ignore it, but soon I was too tired to focus in class. Finally, I said, “Elena, I’m happy you stay in touch with your family, but could you talk a little earlier or use headphones? I need to sleep to feel ready for class.” She immediately understood and said she hadn’t realized it bothered me. From that night on, she used earphones. This experience showed me that good communication is necessary to solve small problems before they become bigger.
        
        The second challenge was about cleaning. I liked to keep my desk very tidy, while Elena often left her paintbrushes and art supplies everywhere. At first, I felt annoyed, but I didn’t want to argue. One Saturday morning, I suggested, “Maybe we can make a cleaning plan so we both feel comfortable.” She agreed, and we decided to clean the room together every Sunday afternoon. She promised to organize her art supplies, and I promised not to complain if she left them out while she was working on a project. This compromise worked well because we both respected the agreement. I realized that compromise means meeting halfway instead of expecting everything my way.
        
        Food was another challenge. At the beginning, we each bought our own groceries, but sometimes she borrowed my bread, and I borrowed her tea. We both started to feel confused about what belonged to whom. Finally, we decided to make a list of shared items—milk, bread, rice, and tea—and split the cost. We kept snacks separate. This small system helped us avoid arguments and also saved money. I learned that living together requires clear rules and fairness.
        
        As the weeks passed, Elena and I became friends. We didn’t just share a room—we shared experiences. Sometimes we cooked pasta together in the dorm kitchen. Sometimes we studied late at night and encouraged each other before exams. I even tried painting with her once, and she read one of my short stories. These activities created a sense of community between us.
        
        One important moment happened during finals week. Many students were stressed, and some didn’t have time to eat properly. Elena suggested we cook a big pot of soup and invite a few classmates to share. At first, I thought it was too much work, but I agreed to help. That evening, our small dorm room was full of laughter and warm food. I realized then that an ideal roommate doesn’t only care about herself but also about others. Living with Elena showed me that community grows when people share kindness and support.
        
        At the end of the semester, I thought about my first fears: noise, mess, and conflict. All of them had happened, but none destroyed our friendship. Instead, through communication, compromise, and community, we turned challenges into lessons. I learned to speak honestly but kindly, to find fair solutions, and to enjoy building a supportive space together.
        
        When people ask me about my ideal roommate, I always describe Elena. She wasn’t perfect—sometimes she left paint everywhere—but she listened, respected me, and cared about others. That, I believe, is what makes an ideal roommate.

        # The Story: _Living with Martin_
        
        When I transferred to a new university, I needed to move into a student apartment. I didn’t know anyone in the city, so the housing office assigned me a roommate named Martin. On the first day, I worried about what it would be like to share space with a stranger. What if he was noisy? What if he was careless with money or cleaning? I had many questions in my mind.
        
        When I met Martin, I felt calmer. He was tall, quiet, and polite. He helped me carry my bags upstairs and showed me the kitchen. We both agreed that we wanted the apartment to feel peaceful and organized. That gave me some confidence that we could live together successfully.
        
        The first problem appeared during the first week. Martin liked to listen to rock music when he studied. The music was not extremely loud, but it distracted me when I tried to read. At first, I thought I could just ignore it, but soon I realized I was not concentrating. Finally, I said, “Martin, I know you enjoy music, but could you please use headphones when I’m studying?” He looked surprised and said, “Of course. I didn’t know it bothered you.” From that day, he used headphones. This small event taught me that **communication** is the best way to solve problems before they become bigger.
        
        The second challenge was cooking. I usually cooked quickly and only made simple food. Martin loved cooking large meals, but he used many pots and pans and left the kitchen messy. At first, I felt annoyed because I often had to clean before I could cook. One evening, I suggested, “Maybe we can cook together twice a week. That way, we can share food and clean the kitchen at the same time.” He liked the idea. We started preparing meals together—sometimes pasta, sometimes rice with vegetables. Cooking together saved time, reduced costs, and created enjoyable evenings. I learned that **compromise** means finding a way where both people benefit.
        
        Cleaning the apartment was another test. I wanted to vacuum every few days, but Martin didn’t care much about dust. After thinking about it, I suggested making a cleaning chart. I offered to vacuum and clean the bathroom if he washed the dishes and took out the trash. He agreed, and we both tried to follow the plan. It wasn’t always perfect, but it gave us a sense of fairness. This experience showed me that compromise also means sharing responsibilities in a balanced way.
        
        As the weeks passed, Martin and I developed a friendship. We studied together in the evenings, and sometimes he explained difficult parts of math to me. In return, I helped him edit his essays for English class. We also started inviting classmates to join us for dinner on Fridays. Slowly, our apartment became more than just a place to sleep—it became a small **community** where people felt welcome.
        
        One special moment happened near the end of the semester. A neighbor in our building broke her arm and couldn’t carry her groceries. Martin quickly offered to help, and I joined him. We carried her bags upstairs and checked on her during the week. I realized then that an ideal roommate is not only someone who respects you but also someone who helps build kindness in the larger community.
        
        At the end of the year, I thought about my experience. At first, I only wanted someone to share rent with. But living with Martin taught me much more. I learned that **communication** makes living together possible, that **compromise** creates fairness and peace, and that **community** grows when people support each other.
        
        When people ask me now about my ideal roommate, I always describe Martin. He wasn’t perfect—sometimes he forgot the cleaning chart—but he listened, respected me, and cared for others. Living with him showed me that roommates are not only people who share space. They are teachers of life lessons about communication, compromise, and community.

        # The Story: _Living with Samira_
        
        When I started college, I moved into a shared apartment near campus. I was excited to live independently, but also nervous. I didn’t know who my roommate would be, and I worried about what it would be like to share my personal space. Questions filled my mind: What if she was messy? What if she was too loud? What if we couldn’t get along?
        
        On moving day, I met Samira, my new roommate. She smiled warmly and said, “Let’s make this apartment feel like home.” Her kind words made me feel more relaxed. We quickly learned that she enjoyed painting, while I enjoyed playing guitar. Our hobbies were different, but we agreed that we both wanted the apartment to be a calm and respectful place.
        
        The first challenge happened with schedules. Samira liked to stay up late painting, while I needed to sleep early to attend morning classes. At first, I tried to ignore the sound of her moving around, but I became tired during the day. Finally, I decided to talk to her. I said, “Samira, I know painting helps you relax, but it’s hard for me to sleep when the light is on. Could you paint earlier or use a smaller lamp?” She immediately agreed, and from that night, she adjusted her schedule. That moment taught me that communication is essential when living with another person.
        
        The second problem was about cleaning. I liked everything organized, but Samira often left her paint supplies scattered across the living room. At first, I felt annoyed and thought it was unfair. One Saturday, I asked, “Could we make a cleaning plan?” She agreed, and we decided that I would vacuum and wash the dishes, while she would tidy the living room and take out the trash. The plan wasn’t perfect—we both forgot sometimes—but it gave us balance. This showed me that compromise means sharing responsibility so both people feel comfortable.
        
        Food was another challenge. I often cooked simple meals like pasta or rice, while Samira liked spicy food with many ingredients. At first, we cooked separately, but it was expensive and produced too many dirty dishes. One evening, I suggested, “Why don’t we cook together twice a week?” She smiled and agreed. Soon, I was learning to cook spicy dishes, and she was enjoying my simple pasta recipes. Cooking together saved money, reduced cleaning, and gave us fun evenings. It also created a small sense of community between us.
        
        As weeks passed, Samira and I became closer. We studied in the library together, helped each other prepare for exams, and sometimes invited friends over for dinner. Our apartment was no longer just a place to sleep—it became a space of teamwork, laughter, and support.
        
        One important moment came when a neighbor downstairs became ill and couldn’t shop for groceries. Samira immediately suggested that we buy food for her. I agreed, and together we delivered groceries and checked on her during the week. Later, the neighbor thanked us and said she felt lucky to live near caring people. That experience showed me that an ideal roommate is not only someone who respects you, but also someone who helps build kindness in the larger community.
        
        At the end of the semester, I thought about everything I had learned. At first, I was worried about noise, cleaning, and food. All those things became opportunities to grow. Living with Samira taught me to speak openly about problems, to accept compromise, and to enjoy building a community with others.
        
        When people ask me now about my ideal roommate, I describe Samira. She wasn’t perfect—sometimes she forgot to take out the trash—but she listened, respected me, and cared about others. Living with her showed me that roommates are not just people who share an apartment. They are partners who teach us about communication, compromise, and community.

        # The Story: _Living with Priya_
        
        When I began my exchange semester in another country, I had to live in a student apartment. The housing office told me I would share a room with a student named Priya. I felt both excited and nervous. It was my first time living with someone from a different culture, and I didn’t know what to expect. I wondered: What if our habits were too different? What if we argued?
        
        On move-in day, Priya welcomed me with a smile. She showed me where the kitchen and laundry room were, and she even helped me carry my suitcase upstairs. We talked for a while, and I learned that she studied computer science, while I studied history. Our interests were not the same, but we both said that we wanted a quiet, respectful space to study. That gave me hope we could be good roommates.
        
        The first problem happened during the second week. Priya liked to talk with her family on video calls in the evening. Sometimes the calls were long and loud, and it was hard for me to focus on reading. At first, I didn’t say anything, but inside I was frustrated. Finally, I decided to talk. I said, “Priya, I understand you need to talk with your family, but it’s hard for me to study when the calls are so loud. Could you use headphones or talk in the common room sometimes?” She immediately agreed and thanked me for telling her. From that moment, she always used headphones. I realized then that **communication** is necessary if we want to solve problems kindly and quickly.
        
        The second challenge was food. I liked simple meals, like pasta or sandwiches. Priya loved cooking traditional dishes, which smelled delicious but also used many spices. Sometimes the smell filled the whole apartment, and I felt uncomfortable. Instead of complaining, I asked her one evening if she could teach me one of her recipes. She was happy and showed me how to cook a vegetable curry. I enjoyed it, and she even tried one of my pasta recipes in return. We decided to cook together once a week, combining her spices with my simple style. This **compromise** not only solved the food problem but also made cooking fun and cheaper.
        
        Cleaning was another test. I usually liked to clean in the morning, while Priya preferred cleaning in the evening. At first, this caused confusion, because sometimes I thought she wasn’t doing her part. One weekend, we sat down and made a schedule. I cleaned the bathroom, and she cleaned the kitchen. We both vacuumed once a week. It wasn’t always perfect, but the plan gave us balance and reduced stress. I learned that compromise means finding a fair system where both people share responsibility.
        
        As weeks passed, we grew closer. We studied together in the library, helped each other practice presentations, and sometimes watched movies in the common room with other students. Slowly, our apartment became more than just a place to sleep. It became a small **community**, where we felt safe, supported, and connected.
        
        One special moment showed me how important community is. A student on our floor became sick during exam week. Priya suggested that we bring her food and check on her. At first, I thought we were too busy, but we did it anyway. The student was very grateful, and soon other people in the building started helping as well. I realized that Priya’s kindness spread to others and made our student residence stronger as a community.
        
        At the end of the semester, I thought about what I had learned. I arrived worried about noise, food, and cleaning. All those things became opportunities to grow. Living with Priya taught me that **communication** helps us express our needs, **compromise** helps us live fairly, and **community** grows when people share kindness.
        
        Now, when people ask me about my ideal roommate, I always describe Priya. She wasn’t perfect—sometimes she cooked late at night and filled the kitchen with dishes—but she listened, respected me, and cared for others. For me, that is the meaning of an ideal roommate.

        # The Story: _Living with Hannah_
        
        When I moved to the city to begin my teacher training program, I had to share an apartment with another student. I was nervous because I had never lived with someone who wasn’t part of my family. The university assigned me to live with Hannah, a nursing student. I didn’t know what to expect, and many questions filled my mind: What if she stayed up late and made noise? What if she didn’t like cleaning? What if we had nothing in common?
        
        On the first day, Hannah greeted me warmly. She had short blond hair and carried a box of kitchen supplies. “I hope we can make this place comfortable,” she said with a smile. Her friendliness made me feel relaxed. We unpacked together, and during that time I learned that she loved jogging in the morning. I told her that I preferred reading in the evenings. Even though we had different habits, we both agreed that respect would be important.
        
        The first challenge came soon. Hannah liked to wake up early to go jogging. She set her alarm for 5:45 a.m., and the sound always woke me up. At first, I tried to ignore it, but I became tired during the day. Finally, I told her, “Hannah, I know jogging is important to you, but the alarm wakes me up every morning. Could you put your phone closer to your bed so you can turn it off quickly?” She understood and agreed. From then on, she silenced her alarm faster, and I was able to rest more. That experience showed me that **communication** is necessary for solving problems in a kind way.
        
        Another challenge was food. I usually bought quick meals like sandwiches and fruit, while Hannah liked cooking large meals with vegetables and rice. Sometimes she borrowed my bread without asking, and once I drank her juice. We both felt uncomfortable. One evening we talked and decided to share the basics like bread, milk, rice, and eggs, while keeping our special items separate. We wrote a list and placed it on the refrigerator. This small **compromise** helped us save money and avoid arguments.
        
        Cleaning was also something we had to organize. I liked to vacuum every week, but Hannah didn’t mind if the floor stayed dusty for a while. At first, I cleaned alone, but soon I felt annoyed. One Saturday, I said, “Why don’t we make a cleaning plan?” She agreed, and we decided that I would vacuum and clean the bathroom, while she washed dishes and took out the trash. The plan wasn’t perfect—we sometimes forgot—but it gave us balance. Through this, I learned that compromise means dividing tasks fairly so both people feel responsible.
        
        As weeks passed, Hannah and I became friends. We sometimes went grocery shopping together, and she even invited me to jog with her on weekends. I joined once, and although I wasn’t very fast, we laughed a lot. In return, I invited her to read short stories with me in the evenings. These shared activities created a small **community** between us.
        
        One important moment came during exam week. Many students in our building were stressed and tired. Hannah suggested we organize a small dinner for our neighbors. At first, I thought it would take too much time, but I agreed. Together we cooked pasta and salad, and we invited three other students. That evening was full of conversation and laughter, and everyone felt less stressed. I realized then that an ideal roommate doesn’t only help you; they also help create a friendly community around them.
        
        By the end of the semester, I looked back at my fears from the first day. I had worried about noise, cleaning, and food. All those things had happened, but they were not disasters. With communication, compromise, and a sense of community, Hannah and I turned problems into lessons. I learned to speak honestly, to share responsibility, and to value cooperation.
        
        When people ask me about my ideal roommate, I describe Hannah. She wasn’t perfect—sometimes she forgot to wash dishes—but she listened, respected me, and cared about others. Living with her showed me that roommates are more than people who share rent. They are partners who teach us about communication, compromise, and community.

        # The Story: _Living with Diego_
        
        When I moved to another city for my first job, I could not afford an apartment by myself. I looked online and found Diego, a student who needed a roommate. We met in a café to talk about our expectations. Diego was friendly and said, “I want our apartment to be a place where we can both feel comfortable.” I agreed, and we decided to share the place.
        
        At first, everything went smoothly. Diego liked playing basketball, while I enjoyed writing in my free time. We respected each other’s hobbies and even shared some interests, like watching action movies. Still, living together soon presented challenges.
        
        The first challenge was about noise. Diego often invited his teammates over after practice. They laughed, played music, and stayed up late. I usually needed to sleep early because I started work at 7 a.m. At first, I felt upset but stayed silent. After several nights, I decided to talk. The next morning, I said, “Diego, I like your friends, but it’s hard for me to sleep when there’s noise after midnight. Could you finish earlier on weekdays?” He listened and said, “I didn’t realize it was a problem. I’ll keep gatherings short during the week.” From then on, the noise stopped, and I learned that communication—clear and respectful—can solve conflicts quickly.
        
        Another problem was cleaning. I preferred a tidy kitchen, but Diego often left dirty dishes in the sink. I felt annoyed and thought about washing them myself, but I knew that wouldn’t be fair. One weekend, I suggested we create a cleaning schedule. We agreed: he would clean the kitchen and take out the trash, while I vacuumed and cleaned the bathroom. It wasn’t perfect, but we both followed the plan most of the time. This showed me that compromise means sharing responsibilities fairly so neither person feels overworked.
        
        Food also caused tension. Sometimes Diego ate my bread, and I used his milk without asking. We both felt uncomfortable. One evening, we sat down and decided to share basics like bread, rice, and milk, while keeping personal snacks separate. We each put money into a small jar every week for the shared items. This compromise saved money and avoided arguments.
        
        Over time, our relationship grew stronger. We began cooking dinner together twice a week. Diego taught me how to make tacos, and I showed him how to cook pasta with tomato sauce. These shared meals not only reduced costs but also gave us enjoyable evenings. Our kitchen became a place of laughter and teamwork, and I realized that living together could also build a small community.
        
        One important moment came during exam season. A neighbor in our building had her laptop break just before a deadline. She looked very stressed. Diego immediately offered his laptop for her to use, and I made her some coffee to help her focus. Together, we supported her until she finished her work. That night, I saw that an ideal roommate is not only someone who respects you, but also someone who cares about others in the wider community.
        
        At the end of the year, I thought about everything I had learned. At first, I only wanted to save money by sharing an apartment. Instead, I discovered life lessons. I learned that communication is the key to solving problems kindly. I learned that compromise allows two people with different habits to live peacefully. And I learned that community grows when people share kindness and responsibility.
        
        Now, when people ask me about my ideal roommate, I describe Diego. He wasn’t perfect—sometimes he forgot to do the dishes—but he listened, respected me, and cared about others. Living with him showed me that roommates are not just people who share rent. They are partners who teach us how to communicate, compromise, and create community.

        # The Story: _Living with Mei_
        
        When I went abroad to study English, I moved into a student dormitory. The university told me I would share a small room with another student named Mei. I was nervous because I had never lived with someone from another culture. I worried about food, cleaning, and daily routines. I asked myself: What if she was too noisy? What if she was too different from me?
        
        On the first day, Mei greeted me warmly. She spoke with a calm voice and said, “I hope we can make this room a good place to study and relax.” Her friendly attitude made me feel comfortable. As we unpacked, I learned she liked drawing, while I enjoyed listening to music. Even though our hobbies were different, we both wanted the room to be quiet and organized. That gave me hope we could live together well.
        
        The first problem happened with study time. Mei liked to study late at night, while I preferred to study in the morning. Sometimes, when I wanted to sleep, she turned on the desk lamp and read her notes. The light made it hard for me to rest. At first, I tried to ignore it, but I soon felt too tired during the day. Finally, I said, “Mei, I know you need to study, but the light keeps me awake. Could we find another solution?” She agreed right away and bought a small desk lamp with a softer light. She also promised to use the library when she wanted to study late. This showed me that communication is the best way to solve conflicts kindly.
        
        The second challenge was cleaning. I liked the floor to be vacuumed every few days, but Mei didn’t think dust was a big problem. At first, I cleaned everything by myself, but I started to feel annoyed. One weekend, I asked, “Could we make a cleaning schedule?” She agreed, and we decided that I would clean the bathroom and sweep the floor, while she washed the dishes and emptied the trash. The plan wasn’t perfect—sometimes we forgot—but it gave us balance. This taught me that compromise means sharing responsibility fairly so no one feels alone in the work.
        
        Food was another area of tension. I often cooked simple meals like rice and chicken, while Mei liked noodles with vegetables. At first, we cooked separately, but this used more money and created a lot of dishes. One day, I suggested we cook together twice a week. She agreed, and soon we were teaching each other recipes. She showed me how to make fried noodles, and I showed her how to make chicken soup. Cooking together became one of our favorite activities and helped us build a sense of community.
        
        Over time, our friendship grew stronger. We studied together in the library, went shopping for groceries, and sometimes joined group activities in the dorm. Slowly, our room became more than just a space for sleeping. It became a place of teamwork and support.
        
        One special moment came when another student in our dorm lost her wallet. She felt stressed and didn’t know what to do. Mei suggested that we lend her some money for food until she could replace her cards. I agreed, and we helped her for several days. Later, the student thanked us and said she felt lucky to have supportive neighbors. That experience showed me that an ideal roommate is not only someone who respects you but also someone who helps build kindness in the larger community.
        
        At the end of the semester, I thought about what I had learned. Living with Mei taught me to speak openly about problems, to accept compromise, and to enjoy the feeling of community. I realized that roommates are not just people who share a room. They are people who can teach us lessons about patience, respect, and cooperation.
        
        When people ask me about my ideal roommate, I think of Mei. She wasn’t perfect—sometimes she left dishes too long in the sink—but she listened, respected me, and cared for others. Living with her showed me that roommates teach us about communication, compromise, and community, the three keys to living together peacefully.
