- [[UAA Halloween Event 2024]] preparations.
# 🗂️ Wednesday

> [!important] Today we’ll attend to those who need to modify their expository essay due to plagiarism. Changes done today in class will receive a change in grade immediately instead of having to wait until the end of the semester. As time permits, we can also discuss originality scores and how to increase them for those who are interested. In order to discuss originality scores, it would need beforehand access to your references in the form of a PDF, which you may submit to your Teams folder: [Final exam week](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAEI/EvU0CMe43ylOkSxR7e4t9mQBfUVYmOELRpYVlko9L-XqPQ?e=9e4k6i).
