A positive evidence recast is a type of feedback that teachers can provide to English language learners (ELLs) to correct their errors without explicitly pointing them out. Recasts are essentially reformulations of the ELL's utterance that are grammatically correct and semantically equivalent. They are considered positive evidence because they provide the ELL with the correct form of the language without explicitly telling them that they made an error.
Positive evidence recasts can be used in a variety of ways in the English language learning classroom. For example, teachers can use them to:
- Correct errors in grammar or pronunciation.
- Provide ELLs with new vocabulary words.
- Model the correct use of a language structure.
- Promote interaction and dialogue between ELLs and native speakers.
To be effective, positive evidence recasts should be:
- Timely: Recasts should be provided immediately after the ELL makes an error.
- Brief: Recasts should be short and to the point.
- Natural: Recasts should be embedded in the natural flow of conversation.
- Non-intrusive: Recasts should not interrupt the ELL's train of thought.
Here are some examples of positive evidence recasts:
- **Grammar:** ELL: "I go to the store yesterday." Teacher: "You went to the store yesterday."
- **Pronunciation:** ELL: "I rike to eat pizza." Teacher: "I like to eat pizza."
- **Vocabulary:** ELL: "I saw a dog." Teacher: "You saw a canine."
- **Language structure:** ELL: "I am going to school tomorrow." Teacher: "I am going to school the day after tomorrow."
Positive evidence recasts can be a valuable tool for helping ELLs improve their English language skills. By providing them with the correct form of the language without explicitly pointing out their errors, teachers can help ELLs learn more effectively and efficiently.
Here are some additional tips for using positive evidence recasts in the classroom:
- Be patient and positive. It may take some time for ELLs to learn the correct form of the language.
- Be sensitive to the ELL's level of proficiency. Recasts should be tailored to the ELL's individual needs.
- Provide opportunities for practice. ELLs need opportunities to practice using the correct form of the language.
- Celebrate successes. When ELLs make progress, be sure to celebrate their successes.
By following these tips, teachers can use positive evidence recasts to help ELLs improve their English language skills and achieve their academic goals.
