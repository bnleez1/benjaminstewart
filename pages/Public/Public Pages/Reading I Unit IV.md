# **Unit 4: Communication, Culture, and a Changing World**
# Stage 1 - Desired Results
## Established Goals
This capstone four-week unit challenges students to think critically about the world they live in. They will explore global cultures, the influence of technology and advertising, and the dynamic nature of the English language itself. Students will synthesize a variety of reading skills—including inferring, scanning, and summarizing—to analyze complex information and understand the forces that shape modern communication and society.
### Transfer
Students will be able to independently use their learning to 1) critically analyze media messages to understand their purpose, bias, and impact; 2) approach interactions with people from different backgrounds with greater curiosity and understanding; 3) make informed decisions as a consumer and a digital citizen; 4) appreciate language as a living, evolving system that reflects history and culture.
### Meaning
### Understandings:
Students will understand that:
- Culture provides the context that shapes how we communicate and interpret the world.
- Technology is a powerful tool that changes how we connect, share information, and perceive reality.
- Advertising aims to influence our behavior and desires by telling a specific kind of story.
- Language is not static; it is constantly evolving to meet the needs of its users.
### Essential Questions:
- How does understanding another culture help us understand our own?
- Is technology bringing the world closer together or driving us further apart?
- How do the messages we see and hear every day shape our choices and identity?
- Why isn't the English we read in Shakespeare the same as the English we use today?
### Acquisition
### _Learners will know…_
Students will know:
- Vocabulary to discuss cultural customs and traditions (e.g., values, beliefs, etiquette, festival).
- Vocabulary related to technology and social media (e.g., digital footprint, algorithm, viral, privacy).
- Vocabulary for analyzing advertising (e.g., target audience, slogan, brand, persuasion).
- Key concepts in the history of English (e.g., Old English, Middle English, loanwords, globalization).
### _Students will be skilled at…_
Students will be skilled at:
- Obtaining general and specific information from complex texts.
- Identifying main ideas and supporting details.
- Inferring meaning, purpose, and bias.
- Scanning for specific data points.
- Summarizing key arguments or information.
# Stage 2 - Assessment Evidence

> [!important] All graded assignments are listed below.
## Performance Task:
**"Global Brand, Local Identity" Analysis Project**
Students will choose a globally recognized brand (e.g., Coca-Cola, Nike, Netflix, McDonald's) and create a presentation analyzing its impact and communication strategies. The analysis must include:
1. **Cultural Adaptation:** Find and analyze an advertisement the brand has used in a different country. Infer how the ad was changed to appeal to local customs and values.
2. **Social Media Impact:** Analyze the brand's social media presence. Scan their feed for examples of how they engage with their audience and infer their strategy for staying relevant.
3. **Advertising Message:** Choose one specific ad campaign and summarize its core message, identifying the main ideas and persuasive techniques used.
4. **Language Use:** Briefly discuss how the brand's slogans or language might be an example of modern, globalized English.
This task requires students to synthesize information and skills from all four weekly topics to produce a comprehensive analysis.
## Other Evidence:
- Quizzes on key vocabulary.
- Short written responses inferring the meaning of a cultural proverb or tradition.
- A timed activity where students must scan a social media feed or tech article to find specific pieces of information.
- Group presentations summarizing the persuasive strategies in a chosen advertisement.
- A short quiz identifying the main ideas in a text about the history of English.
# Stage 3 - Learning Plan
## Learning Plan (WHERETO)
### **Week 1: Cultures and Customs Around the World**
- **W (Where/Why):** Introduce the unit and the "Global Brand" final project. Explain that to understand a global brand, we must first understand global cultures.
- **H (Hook):** Show students images of different greetings from around the world (a bow, a handshake, a hongi). Ask them to infer what these greetings might say about the culture.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce vocabulary for culture. Students will read short texts about unique customs or festivals. They will practice getting the general idea, finding specific details, and inferring cultural values from the descriptions.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** In groups, students will research a custom from a specific country and create a short "Do's and Don'ts" guide for a visitor. They will then present it to the class for feedback.
- **E (Evaluate):** An exit ticket asking students to read a short paragraph about a cultural practice and infer one of the culture's underlying values.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide a range of texts on different cultures so students can choose topics that interest them. Offer a graphic organizer to help structure their research.
- **O (Organize):** The week is organized to build a foundation of cultural awareness and practice the key skill of inference.
### **Week 2: Technology and Social Media**
- **W:** Connect to the project: "How do we learn about these cultures and brands? Often, through technology. This week, we'll analyze that tool."
- **H (Hook):** Start with a poll: "Do you think social media has a mostly positive or mostly negative effect on society?" and have a brief debate.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce vocabulary for technology and social media. Students will read articles about the impact of technology. They will practice identifying main arguments, scanning for statistics or data, and inferring the author's point of view.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** Students will analyze their own social media feed (or a provided example) and reflect on the type of content they see and why.
- **E (Evaluate):** A worksheet where students read an article about a new app and must scan to find its purpose, cost, and target user, then infer if the author is for or against it.
- **T (Tailor):** Use articles and examples relevant to students' lives, such as discussions about TikTok, Instagram, or video games.
- **O (Organize):** The week focuses on applying reading skills to the fast-paced, information-dense world of technology.
### **Week 3: The World of Advertising**
- **W:** Frame the week within the project: "We've looked at culture and technology. Now let's see how companies use both to send us a message through advertising."
- **H (Hook):** Show a very effective and memorable TV commercial (either famous or local) and ask, "Why does that ad work? What does it make you want to do or feel?"
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce vocabulary for advertising and persuasion. Students will analyze print ads, commercials, and online pop-ups. They will practice identifying the main message, inferring the target audience, and summarizing the persuasive strategy.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** In groups, students will be given a simple object (e.g., a pencil) and have to create a simple ad for it, defining their target audience and slogan. They will then "pitch" their ad to another group.
- **E (Evaluate):** Students will write a short paragraph summarizing the main message and intended audience of a print advertisement.
- **T (Tailor):** Allow groups to create their ad in different formats (a poster, a short script, a jingle) to cater to different strengths.
- **O (Organize):** This week is highly analytical, breaking down familiar media to understand its construction and purpose.
### **Week 4: Stories – Evolution of English**
- **W:** Introduce the final piece of the puzzle: "The language used by these global brands is English, but it's a language that has a long story and is always changing."
- **H (Hook):** Show students a short, simple text written in Old English or Chaucer's Middle English alongside its modern translation. Ask: "What do you notice? Can you recognize any words?"
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce key concepts and vocabulary for the history of English. Students will read a short, simplified text or watch a video about how English evolved, absorbing influences from other languages. The focus will be on obtaining general information and identifying the main ideas of each stage of development.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** Students will work on preparing and finalizing their "Global Brand, Local Identity" projects, integrating feedback from peers and the instructor.
- **E (Evaluate):** The final project and presentation will serve as the summative assessment for the unit.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide a clear rubric and checklist for the final project. Schedule one-on-one check-ins to support students as they finalize their work.
- **O (Organize):** The week provides the final piece of content while dedicating the majority of the time to the synthesis of all unit skills in the culminating performance task.
