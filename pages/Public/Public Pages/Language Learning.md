_Language Learning_ is devoted to fundamental theoretical issues in the learning of language by children and adults, including second, heritage, Indigenous, and foreign language development, bilingualism, literacy, language representation in mind and brain, language cognition, co-speech gestures, and pragmatics. It publishes empirical and theoretical articles that apply methods of inquiry from disciplines including psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, neuroscience, and educational research. We welcome studies of the learning of oral, signed, and written language and across diverse naturalistic, formal, and laboratory settings.
