## Methodology
The course methodology will be student-centered, as well as problem-solving, projects, and everyday situations in the English language in different authentic contexts. Students will be able to experience and reproduce the English language through authentic oral and written texts. These come from audios, videos, and readings (e.g., informal conversations, news, lectures, song lyrics, etc.) which they will review in individual, pair, or team work. The teacher's main role will be that of facilitator, while the student will be an active and responsible participant in their learning process. During the course, the development of learning strategies will be promoted through techniques  
such as debates, conversations, discussions, playful activities, analysis of texts and audios, using a variety of interactions, authentic materials, and ICTs.
