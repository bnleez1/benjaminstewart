> [!important] Schedule in CAADI and submit to the virtual classroom.
## Instructions
Each of the five CAADI worksheets for Writing I will require that you schedule time with a CAADI tutor for completing a written activity (i.e., a paragraph). The paragraph that you create during this activity will be the basis for completing your Grammar I CAADI worksheet (i.e., an analysis of form, meaning, and use).
