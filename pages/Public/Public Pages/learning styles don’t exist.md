[The article](https://fee.org/articles/learning-styles-don-t-actually-exist-studies-show/) discusses the theory of learning styles, which is the idea that people learn best in different ways, such as through visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learning. However, ==_the article argues that there is no scientific evidence to support this theory_==.
The article concludes that the learning styles theory is a myth, and that there is no need to try to identify and cater to different learning styles in the classroom. Instead, _teachers should focus on using a variety of teaching methods that appeal to different learners_.
Here are some of the key points from the article:
- The learning styles theory is based on the idea that people have different preferences for how they learn.
- There is no scientific evidence to support the learning styles theory.
- Some studies have found that matching instruction to a student's supposed learning style can actually hurt their learning.
- Teachers should focus on using a variety of teaching methods that appeal to different learners.
