In a big, green park lived a small ant named Ari. Ari was a very busy ant. Every day, he had a schedule. From morning to evening, his day was full of appointments.
In the morning, his first job was to collect food. He would march in a long line with his brothers and sisters. They were all very disciplined. They did not stop. They did not play. They just worked. Ari’s job was to find big crumbs of bread.
In the afternoon, Ari had another engagement. He helped build the anthill. He carried small pieces of dirt and tiny rocks. The anthill was very big and complex. Every ant had a role. Every ant had a job to do. Ari was a good worker. He was always on time. He never missed a deadline for his work.
One sunny afternoon, a family came to the park for a picnic. They had a big basket full of delicious food. There was bread, cheese, sweet strawberries, and a big chocolate cake. Ari saw the picnic from far away. His schedule said he needed to work on the anthill. But the smell of the strawberries was amazing.
For the first time, Ari thought about his schedule. He always followed his plan. He was always responsible. But he never had any fun. He saw the family laughing and eating. They did not have a strict schedule. They were just enjoying the beautiful day together.
Ari made a decision. He decided to cancel his afternoon appointment with the anthill. He wanted to do something different. He wanted an adventure.
He walked slowly toward the picnic blanket. He was a little scared. The people were very big. But he was also very excited. He hid behind a blade of grass and watched. He saw a small crumb of cheese fall from the table. This was his chance!
He ran to the crumb. It was much bigger than the crumbs he usually found. It was heavy. He tried to push it, but it did not move. He was a small ant, and the cheese was a big prize. He felt disappointed. His adventure was a failure. He should have just followed his schedule.
Just then, he heard a small voice. “Do you need some help?”
Ari looked up. It was another ant. Her name was Lila. Lila was not from his anthill. She was from a different colony.
“Yes, please,” said Ari. “This cheese is too heavy for me.”
Lila smiled. “We can do it together.”
Ari and Lila pushed the cheese crumb together. It was still heavy, but now it moved. Slowly, they pushed the cheese across the grass. They worked as a team. During their journey, they talked. Ari told Lila about his busy schedule. Lila told Ari about her colony, where they worked hard but also had time to explore.
Finally, they reached Ari’s anthill with the giant cheese crumb. All the other ants came out to see. They were amazed. They had never seen such a big piece of cheese.
Ari’s queen was very happy. She looked at Ari and Lila. “You did not follow your schedule, Ari,” she said. Ari was worried. But then the queen smiled. “But you brought back a great treasure for the colony. And you made a new friend. Sometimes, the best appointments are the ones you do not plan.”
From that day on, Ari’s schedule changed. He still worked hard in the morning. He still helped build the anthill. But he also made time for new things. He made time for adventure. And he always made time to visit his new friend, Lila. They often went on adventures together, always ready for the unexpected.
