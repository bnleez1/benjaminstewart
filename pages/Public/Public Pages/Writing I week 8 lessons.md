- [[Understanding Theme and Rheme in Writing]]
## Two common theme and rheme patterns
### Pattern 1: Same Theme, New Rheme
In this pattern, the theme remains the same across consecutive sentences, while the rheme introduces new information each time. This helps to expand on the initial topic in a coherent manner.
**Example:**
1. **Theme:** “The new policy”**Rheme:** “will affect all employees starting next month.”
2. **Theme:** “The new policy”**Rheme:** “includes changes to the vacation schedule.”
### Pattern 2: Rheme to Theme
In this pattern, the rheme of the first sentence becomes the theme of the next sentence. This creates a logical progression of ideas and ensures a smooth flow of information.
**Example:**
1. **Theme:** “The new policy”**Rheme:** “will affect all employees starting next month.”
2. **Theme:** “All employees”**Rheme:** “will need to attend a training session.”

    - Emma’s Story
        
        **The Journey to Wellness**
        
        In a small town nestled between rolling hills, lived a woman named Emma. ==Emma== had always been conscious of her health, but it wasn’t until she turned thirty that she truly began to understand the importance of taking care of her body. She decided to embark on a journey to wellness, determined to transform her lifestyle.

        Every morning, Emma wakes up at dawn. The sun rises slowly, casting a golden hue over the landscape. She stretches her arms, feeling the muscles in her back loosen. After a quick breakfast, she heads out for a run. Running along the winding paths, she feels the cool breeze against her skin. The rhythmic pounding of her feet on the ground becomes a meditative practice, clearing her mind and energizing her body.
        
        Emma’s diet also undergoes a significant change. She starts incorporating more fruits and vegetables into her meals, discovering new recipes that are both nutritious and delicious. Cooking becomes a creative outlet for her, and she enjoys experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. She learns to listen to her body, understanding when it needs fuel and when it needs rest.
        
        One day, while browsing through a local bookstore, Emma stumbles upon a book about yoga. Intrigued, she decides to give it a try. She joins a yoga class, where she meets others who are also on their own wellness journeys. The instructor, a kind and patient woman named Maya, guides them through various poses and breathing exercises. Emma finds that yoga not only strengthens her body but also calms her mind. She practices regularly, feeling more balanced and centered with each session.
        
        As the months pass, Emma notices significant changes in her body and mind. She feels stronger, more flexible, and more resilient. Her energy levels increase, and she finds herself more focused and productive at work. She also becomes more mindful of her mental health, taking time each day to meditate and reflect.
        
        Emma’s journey to wellness is not without its challenges. There are days when she feels tired and unmotivated, but she reminds herself of her goals and pushes through. She learns to be kind to herself, understanding that progress is not always linear. She celebrates her achievements, no matter how small, and uses setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow.
        
        One evening, Emma sits on her porch, watching the sunset. She reflects on her journey, feeling a deep sense of gratitude for the changes she has made. She realizes that wellness is not just about physical health but also about nurturing the mind and spirit. She feels a sense of peace and fulfillment, knowing that she is taking care of herself in the best way possible.
        
        Emma’s story inspires others in her community to embark on their own wellness journeys. She shares her experiences, offering tips and encouragement to those who are just starting out. She becomes a source of support and motivation, helping others to discover the joy and benefits of a healthy lifestyle.
        
        Years later, Emma looks back on her journey with pride. She continues to prioritize her health, always seeking new ways to improve and grow. She understands that wellness is a lifelong journey, one that requires dedication and commitment. But she also knows that it is a journey worth taking, for the rewards are immeasurable.
