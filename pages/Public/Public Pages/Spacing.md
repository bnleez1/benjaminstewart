The concept of spacing, also known as "distributed practice," is another key learning strategy discussed in "Make It Stick." ==Spacing refers to spreading out learning sessions over time== rather than massing them all together in a short period—what is commonly known as cramming. When we space out our study sessions, we give ourselves time to forget and re-learn the material, which surprisingly makes the learning stronger. This forgetting and re-learning process helps to reinforce the memory traces in our brain, leading to deeper learning and better long-term retention.
The principle behind spacing is that memories consolidate over time and that the act of retrieving these memories (especially when it's a little difficult to do so) strengthens them. If we study something again just as we're about to forget it, we reinforce it more effectively than if we studied it multiple times in quick succession.
### Examples within the Context of Second Language Acquisition:
**1. Vocabulary Retention:**  
Instead of trying to memorize a list of new words in one sitting, a learner could study a few words each day and revisit each set of words at increasing intervals—perhaps one day later, then three days, then a week, and so on. This method could be used in conjunction with flashcards, where cards are reviewed at spaced intervals, and cards that are difficult are reviewed more frequently than those that are easier.
**2. Grammar Mastery:**  
Grammar concepts can be practiced over multiple sessions spread across weeks or months. For instance, a learner might practice the present tense in one session, the past tense a few days later, and the future tense even later, periodically returning to each to consolidate the knowledge.
**3. Skill Development:**  
Skills such as listening and speaking can benefit from spacing. A learner might practice listening to dialogues or podcasts in the target language, allowing some time to pass, and then revisiting the same materials or similar ones to reinforce comprehension and retention.
**4. Writing Practice:**  
Writing essays or journal entries in the target language benefits from a spaced approach. A learner might write on different topics over time and come back to rework earlier pieces with fresh eyes after some time has passed, reinforcing the language structures learned.
**5. Reading for Depth:**  
Instead of reading a novel or a series of articles in the target language all at once, spacing out reading sessions allows for time to reflect on vocabulary and themes, which enhances understanding and retention.
**6. Cultural Immersion:**  
If possible, spaced exposure to the cultural contexts of the language, such as movies, music, or conversation with native speakers, can help in understanding the nuanced use of the language over time.
Incorporating the spacing effect into language study routines means resisting the urge to do marathon sessions that focus on one area. Instead, learners benefit from shorter, more frequent study times that revisit material from previous lessons at well-timed intervals. This approach works with the brain's natural learning processes and has been shown to significantly improve long-term retention of information.
