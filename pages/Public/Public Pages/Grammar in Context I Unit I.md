# **¡Conectemos! (Let's Connect!)**
# Stage 1 - Desired Results
## Established Goals
- **Communication:**
- Interpersonal Communication: I can communicate and exchange information on a variety of familiar topics using phrases and simple sentences.
- **Cultures:**
- Relating Cultural Practices to Perspectives: I can use the language to investigate, explain, and reflect on the relationship between the practices and perspectives of the cultures studied.
- **Connections:**
- Making Connections: I can use the language to investigate, explain, and reflect on the concept of social connection through the lens of the Spanish language.
### Transfer
Learners will be able to independently use their learning to navigate a social gathering (e.g., a party, a café, a new school) where they can confidently introduce themselves, engage in small talk about their lives and families, and interact with service personnel to order food and drinks.
### Meaning
### Understandings:
Learners will understand that...
- Language is a bridge to building new relationships and understanding diverse communities.
- Our daily routines and social interactions are shaped by cultural norms and values.
- Effective communication involves both understanding words and interpreting social cues.
### Essential Questions:
- How do we use language to build connections with others?
- What can we learn about a culture through its social customs?
- How does what we say, and how we say it, change in different situations?

- **Week 3 (Familiares y amigos):** Vocabulary for family members and friends; descriptive adjectives and the verb _ser_.
