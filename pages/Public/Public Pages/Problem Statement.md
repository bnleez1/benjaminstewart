A relevant research problem acts as a guiding light, directing the researcher's efforts and ensuring their work has a meaningful impact. When research addresses a pressing issue, it generates knowledge and solutions that can make a real difference in the world. Relevant research also attracts interest and support from funding agencies, collaborators, and the broader community, increasing its visibility and chances of success. By tackling relevant problems, researchers ensure their work remains valuable and contributes to the advancement of knowledge and the betterment of society.
Review how to [[Narrowing Down a Topic]] to complete the following prompt:
- _I wish to learn more about..._ [topic] _because I want to know how, why, when, where, etc..._ [indirect question] _in order to..._ [significance of the problem, relevance, big picture].
## Note
- The problem statement is one sentence with no italicized text or brackets.
- The problem statement contains three parts: 1) the topic (general concept), 2) an indirect question that is related to the topic but is much more specific (i.e., usually a _why_ or _how_ question word), and 3) the significance of the problem that relates to the _target audience_ and the purpose of the written text.
- The indirect question is the essential question of the entire text (i.e., five-paragraph essay, literature review, etc.). The thesis statement (see [[Thesis statement and skeleton outline]]) answers the (indirect/direct) question mentioned in the problem statement. The indirect question relates to the significance of the problem but should address a possible solution when writing a problem-solution essay. For a problem-solution essay, the problem is developed in the introduction paragraph while the thesis statement that concludes the introduction paragraph presents a possible solution. The subsequent body paragraphs unpack the three key points listed at the end of the thesis statement.
- The significance that concludes a problem statement reveals the actual problem explicitly. Consider what you (the author) want to do with your essay, your intention, etc. If you are persuading someone to take action or to think differently about something, who is the target audience? Be specific. What’s the relevance, big picture, overall purpose or reason for considering such an indirect question (and later thesis statement)?
    
    ## Examples
    
    > [!important] Some of the examples are better than others. In most cases, the indirect question can be improved by being more specific. Also, in some cases the indirect question focuses more on a problem instead of a solution. I suggest that the indirect question focus on a possible solution by asking, “how” or “why”.
