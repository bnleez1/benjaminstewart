- Review [[Skimming and Scanning]].
    
    ### Tactics for Skimming
    
    1. **Read Titles, Subheadings, and Bold Text**
        
        These elements often summarize the main topics and ideas.
        
    2. **Look at the First and Last Sentences of Paragraphs**
        
        In many English texts, the topic sentence comes first and the concluding sentence sums up the main point.
        
    3. **Notice Visual Cues**
        
        Images, charts, bullet points, and highlighted words can provide quick insight into content.
        
    4. **Avoid Stopping for Unknown Words**
        
        The goal is speed, not full comprehension. Skip unfamiliar words unless they seem essential to the main idea.
        
    5. **Glance Over the Introduction and Conclusion**
        
        These sections often restate the main points in condensed form.
        
    
    ### Tactics for Scanning
    
    1. **Know What You’re Looking For**
        
        Have a clear target (e.g., a date, percentage, or name) before you begin.
        
    2. **Use Visual Clues**
        
        Numbers, capital letters, italics, and bold type stand out and can guide your eyes.
        
    3. **Move Your Eyes Quickly Down the Page**
        
        Let your eyes jump from section to section rather than reading in order.
        
    4. **Use Finger or Pen Guidance**
        
        Pointing at the page while moving downward can help you stay focused.
        
    5. **Ignore Irrelevant Information**
        
        Skip over sentences or sections that don’t contain your target.

        ## **Text 1 – “A Day at the Street Market”**
        
        **(Approx. 700 words)**
        
        Every Sunday morning, the main street in the center of San Miguel changes. Instead of cars, the road is full of colorful stalls, busy sellers, and excited shoppers. The air smells of fresh bread, roasted coffee, and grilled meat. You can hear music from a nearby band, the sound of people bargaining, and children laughing.
        
        The market is open from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., and it has been a tradition for more than 50 years. People come here to buy vegetables, fruit, meat, clothes, shoes, and sometimes even furniture. There are also small stands selling hot food. One popular food is _gorditas_—thick tortillas filled with beans, cheese, or meat. Another is _tamales_, wrapped in corn leaves and served with spicy sauce.
        
        Many people visit the market not just for shopping but for meeting friends. “I see my neighbors here every week,” says Carmen, a local resident. “We talk, share news, and have breakfast together.”
        
        At the far end of the street, there is a section for handicrafts. Here, you can find hand-painted pottery, woven baskets, and embroidered blouses. Tourists often take photos and buy souvenirs to take home.
        
        The market is also an important place for farmers. Small producers from nearby villages bring their harvest to sell directly to customers. This way, they earn more money and avoid paying supermarket fees.
        
        However, the market is not without problems. Sometimes, it gets too crowded, and moving through the narrow space is difficult. On hot days, the smell from raw meat and fish can be unpleasant. Also, the parking areas fill up quickly, making it hard for visitors to find a spot.
        
        Despite these issues, the Sunday market remains a favorite for locals and tourists alike. “It’s part of our culture,” says Luis, a shop owner. “It’s not just about buying things. It’s about community.”

        ### **Tasks**

            - a) A supermarket in San Miguel
            - b) The Sunday street market tradition
            - c) How to make _tamales_
        
        **Scanning:**
        
        3. What time does the market open and close?
        
        4. Name three foods mentioned in the text.

        ## **Text 2 – “The City Park Makeover”**
        
        **(Approx. 700 words)**
        
        Last year, the city council decided to renovate Central Park. The park, located in the heart of the city, had not been updated for over 20 years. The playground equipment was old and rusty, the walking paths were cracked, and many benches were broken.
        
        The renovation started in March and finished in December. Workers built new walking and cycling paths, planted over 200 trees, and installed a new children’s playground with swings, slides, and climbing structures. There is now a large fountain in the middle of the park with lights that change color at night.
        
        One of the main goals of the project was to make the park more eco-friendly. Solar-powered lamps now light the park at night, and there are recycling bins every 50 meters. A new pond was also built to collect rainwater for watering plants.
        
        The park has become a popular place for exercise. Every morning, people jog or ride their bicycles along the paths. Yoga classes are held on the grass, and families enjoy picnics under the shade of the new trees.
        
        Local residents are happy with the changes. “It’s safer, cleaner, and more beautiful,” says Roberto, who lives nearby. “I come here every weekend with my children.”
        
        However, some people complain about the cost of the renovation, which was over 5 million pesos. Others say the park now feels too modern and has lost some of its old charm.
        
        Despite the mixed opinions, the new park has attracted more visitors than ever before. The city council hopes it will encourage people to spend more time outdoors and lead healthier lives.

        ## **Text 3 – “A Trip to the Mountains”**
        
        **(Approx. 700 words)**
        
        Last weekend, four friends—Ana, Miguel, Laura, and Pablo—decided to go hiking in the Sierra Verde mountains. They left early on Saturday morning, carrying backpacks full of water, sandwiches, fruit, and warm clothes. The weather was cool and sunny, perfect for walking.
        
        Their plan was to reach the top of Cerro Alto, the highest point in the area at 2,500 meters. The trail was about 8 kilometers long, and they expected it to take four hours. Along the way, they saw wildflowers, butterflies, and even a family of deer.
        
        Halfway up, they stopped for lunch near a small waterfall. The water was crystal clear and cold, and they took turns filling their bottles. Miguel took many photos of the scenery, while Laura collected colorful leaves for her scrapbook.
        
        As they got closer to the top, the trail became steeper and more difficult. Ana felt tired and wanted to stop, but the others encouraged her to keep going. Finally, after four and a half hours, they reached the summit. The view was spectacular—they could see the entire valley, rivers, and tiny villages far below.
        
        They took a group photo at the top and enjoyed the fresh mountain air before starting the descent. Going down was faster, but they had to be careful not to slip on the loose rocks.
        
        By the time they returned to their car, the sun was setting. They were tired but happy. “It was hard work, but totally worth it,” said Ana.
