An absolute phrase is a grammatical construction that consists of a noun or pronoun accompanied by a participial phrase (or sometimes a noun and its modifiers), which is often introduced by a participle. An absolute phrase is not directly connected to the rest of the sentence in terms of grammatical dependency; rather, it provides additional information that helps to describe or provide context to the main subject or action of the sentence. Absolute phrases are set off by commas and contribute to a more detailed and nuanced description of the situation or scene being discussed.
Here are examples of absolute phrases in different contexts:
