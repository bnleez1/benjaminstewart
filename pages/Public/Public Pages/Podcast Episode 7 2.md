- Review podcast requirements.
- Read and post comments below as necessary.**Ways you can record your podcast**
- Use your cell phone to record your episode.
- Record yourself in Microsoft Teams (audio and video). Then download the file.
- Use Audacity ([https://www.audacityteam.org/](https://www.audacityteam.org/)) to record yourself on your computer (audio only).
- Use OBS ([https://obsproject.com/](https://obsproject.com/)) to record yourself on your computer (audio & video).**How to edit your audio or video**
I think kdenlive ([https://kdenlive.org/en/](https://kdenlive.org/en/)) is a good option to edit audio and video files, but there are many options available online. I would try to avoid editing and practice enough times where editing is not necessary.
