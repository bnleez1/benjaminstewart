    - **Complementary to Grammar**: Students see a strong connection between grammar and writing, noting that both subjects complement each other and help improve their overall English skills.
    - **Improvement Noted**: Several students have noticed significant improvements in their writing abilities since the semester started, especially in producing their own texts.
    - **Support and Resources**: While some students feel lost or confused, they find support from friends, teachers, and additional resources like YouTube videos helpful.
    - **Confidence and Challenges**: Confidence levels vary; some students feel confident and enjoy the class, while others feel insecure and struggle with sentence structure and vocabulary.
    - **Teacher’s Role**: The teacher’s explanations are generally well-received, helping students understand difficult topics.
    - **Personal Effort**: Many students are committed to improving and are putting in extra effort to understand and complete activities.
    - **Enjoyment and Learning**: Despite the challenges, students generally enjoy the class and find it interesting and beneficial for their learning.
