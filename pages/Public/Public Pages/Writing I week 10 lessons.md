# 🗂️ Monday
- Example giving instructions
    
    How do you get to school from your home?
    
    > [!important] Be specific. How long? How many blocks? etc.
    
    First, I leave my house and turn right onto Maple Street. I walk straight for about five minutes until I reach the intersection with Oak Avenue. At the intersection, I turn left and continue walking for another three minutes. I see a large park on my right. 
    
    I cross the street at the pedestrian crossing and enter the park. I walk through the park, following the main path. After about ten minutes, I come to a small bridge. I cross the bridge and exit the park on the other side.
    
    Once I am out of the park, I turn right onto Pine Street. I walk straight for about seven minutes until I see a big red building on my left. This is the library. 
    
    From the library, I turn left onto Elm Street. I walk straight for about five minutes. I pass a bakery and a post office on my right. I keep going until I reach the traffic lights.
    
    At the traffic lights, I turn right onto School Road. I walk straight for about three minutes. I see the school entrance on my left. The school is a large white building with a blue sign.
