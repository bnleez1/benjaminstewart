# The Art of Conversation: Mastering Essential Skills for English Interactions

> [!important] Get ready to put your English conversation skills to the test! We're going to have a fun networking event where you'll meet new people, practice making eye contact and smiling, using names, shaking hands, asking great questions, and showing you're interested through your body language. Don't worry, we'll practice all the important words and phrases before we start. This is your chance to shine and make connections, just like you would in real life!
## Task
1. **Planning (15 min)**
    - Choose each context.
    - Draft bullet points of key facts (name, background, interests).
        - Ways of introducing yourself.
            - **Formal Academic Introduction**: "Hello, my name is [Name]. I'm a first-year student at [University] majoring in [Field of Study]. I'm particularly interested in [Specific Academic Interest] and I'm currently taking [Current Courses]. It's nice to meet you."
            - **Casual Dormitory/Social Introduction**: "Hi there! I'm [Name]. I'm from [Hometown] and this is my first semester here. I enjoy [Hobbies/Interests] when I'm not studying. What dorm are you in?"
            - **Student Club/Organization Introduction**: "Hello, I'm [Name]. I'm new to campus and studying [Major]. I'm really interested in [Activity/Topic related to the club] and I'm looking to meet people who share similar interests and possibly join some student organizations."
            - **Classroom Setting Introduction**: "Good morning/afternoon everyone. My name is [Name] and I'm a freshman/first-year studying [Major]. I'm excited about [Specific Topic/Class], and I hope to learn more about [Related Area] during my time here."
    - Decide what is appropriate to share for each context.
2. **Writing (20 min)**
    - Write 5-7 _complete sentences_ for each introduction, ensuring:
        - At least 2 **sentences in Present Simple**.
        - At least 2 **sentence in Present Continuous**.
        - At least 4 **adjectives** describing self, work, and/or interests.
3. **Peer Review (10 min)**
    - Exchange with a partner.
    - Partner checks grammar, clarity, cultural relevance, and tone.
4. **Rehearsal (10 min)**
    - Practice speaking introductions aloud.
    - Focus on clarity, pacing, and body language.
5. Reflection Paragraph (5-6 sentences)
    1. Which context was easier for you? Why?
    2. What changes would you make for each audience?
    3. How will you apply this skill in the future?
