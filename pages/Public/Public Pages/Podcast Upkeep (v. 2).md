- Private podcasts (in OneDrive): Use the following nomenclature for each of your podcast episodes: **Ep01_Title of the episode**. Include up to the first five words of your title when naming your audio/video file. For public podcasts, this step is not required.
- Go to the Student Podcasts OneNote file and select the "1st Semester" section. Add a page and rename it using your full name (first name first...).
- Alphabetize your OneNote page according to your first name.
- Add a description of your podcast stating what, why (purpose or reason for the podcast), and to whom (target audience) in your OneNote page.
- Provide a link (hypertext)... a "pretty link" to your podcast or shared OneDrive if private to your OneNote page.
- Add the attached (1st Sem) image to your page in OneNote.
