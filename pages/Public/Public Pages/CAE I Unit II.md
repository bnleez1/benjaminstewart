### Essential Questions:
Learners will keep considering...
- How do we adapt our communication to effectively persuade others?

# Stage 3 - Learning Plan
## Learning Plan (WHERETO)
### **Week 1 (Course Weeks 9-10): Education & The Environment**
- **W (Where/Why):** The unit will be introduced by showing two contrasting clips: one of an innovative school and one of a pressing environmental issue. We will ask: "What does an ideal future look like, and how do we use our voice to advocate for it?" The final project (podcast/essay) will be introduced to show where we are heading.
- **H (Hook/Hold):** Hook students with a debate: "Should school uniforms be mandatory?" and hold interest by having them research an environmental issue they are passionate about.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Students will read articles on different education systems and environmental problems. They will listen to educational podcasts and nature documentaries. We will explicitly teach and practice **reported speech** (for quoting sources) and the **passive voice** (common in formal/scientific writing).
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students will reflect in a journal: "What was my most meaningful learning experience in school and why?" and "What is one change I can make in my daily life to help the environment?"
- **E (Evaluate):** Students will be evaluated on their participation in discussions and the completion of their **School Brochure** and **Eco-project Plan**.
- **T (Tailor):** Instruction will be tailored by allowing students to choose which educational models and environmental issues they research based on interest.
- **O (Organize):** The week will begin with vocabulary and grammar input, move to receptive skills practice (reading/listening), and culminate in productive, task-based outputs (discussions and mini-projects).
### **Week 2 (Course Weeks 11-12): Fashion & Music**
- **W (Where/Why):** We will connect these topics to the larger theme of identity and expression. We'll ask: "How do the clothes we wear and the music we listen to tell a story about who we are?"
- **H (Hook/Hold):** Hook students by having them bring in and discuss an object of clothing or a song that is meaningful to them. Hold interest by having them plan a "thematic fashion show" or a "soundtrack for their life."
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Students will read fashion blogs and music reviews. They will watch fashion and music interviews. We will teach **comparatives/superlatives** for making judgments and the **past perfect** for sequencing past events (e.g., "By the time I discovered the band, they had already released three albums").
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students will discuss in groups: "Is fast fashion worth the ethical and environmental cost?" and "How has technology changed the way we experience music?"
- **E (Evaluate):** Evaluation will be based on the **Fashion Show Presentation** and the **Music Playlist Project**, which will require them to justify their choices using the target language.
- **T (Tailor):** Students will have complete freedom to choose the fashion styles and music genres they want to focus on for their projects.
- **O (Organize):** The week will be organized around personal expression, moving from individual reflection to collaborative project creation.
### **Week 3 (Course Weeks 13-14): Traditions & Careers**
- **W (Where/Why):** We will explore how we honor our past and plan for our future. We'll ask: "How do our traditions connect us to our community, and how do we prepare for our professional futures?"
- **H (Hook/Hold):** Hook students with a vibrant video montage of different cultural festivals around the world. Hold their interest by having them take a career aptitude quiz and discuss the results.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Students will read articles about festivals and career advice. They will watch festival documentaries and sample job interviews. We will teach the **future perfect** ("By 2030, I will have finished my degree") and **first/second conditionals** for discussing future plans and hypothetical situations. Students will learn the format of a CV.
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students will reflect on a family or community tradition that is important to them. They will also outline their five-year career plan and identify potential obstacles.
- **E (Evaluate):** Students will be evaluated on their **Festival Presentation**, their completed **CV**, and their performance in a **Mock Interview**.
- **T (Tailor):** Students can choose to present on a festival from their own culture or one that interests them. They can tailor their CV and mock interview to a job they are genuinely interested in.
- **O (Organize):** This week is structured to build from the cultural/communal (festivals) to the individual/professional (careers), giving students language to talk about both their roots and their future.
### **Week 4 (Course Weeks 15-16): Celebrations, Relationships & Final Projects**
- **W (Where/Why):** This final week is focused on synthesis and performance. The theme is connection—to people we care about and ideas we have developed. We will focus on polishing the final performance tasks.
- **H (Hook/Hold):** Hook students by sharing heartwarming stories about holiday celebrations or by presenting a challenging relationship dilemma for them to solve.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Students will read articles about different holidays and relationships. They will listen to podcasts offering relationship advice. We will review **prepositions of time** (in, on, at) for discussing celebrations and **relative clauses** (who, which, that, whose) for adding detail when describing people and things. The majority of class time will be a workshop for drafting essays and recording podcasts.
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students will conduct peer reviews of essay drafts and do practice runs of their podcasts, using a rubric to provide constructive feedback. We will have a final whole-class reflection on the unit's essential questions.
- **E (Evaluate):** This week's formal evaluation consists of the submission of the final **Podcast** and **Persuasive Essay**. The smaller **Holiday Scrapbook** and **Relationship Advice Column** tasks will be the final additions to the portfolio.
- **T (Tailor):** The workshop format allows the instructor to provide tailored, one-on-one feedback to students and groups based on their specific needs for the final projects.
- **O (Organize):** The week is organized as a "project runway," with initial practice, workshop time for development and refinement, and a final showcase/submission of the two major performance tasks.
