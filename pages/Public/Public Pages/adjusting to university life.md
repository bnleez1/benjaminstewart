    Welcome to the mind Your mind podcast. Brought to you by the Birkbeck counselling service. In this series of podcasts, we are looking at what different issues might bring students to the counselling service. We'll share our thinking about those difficulties. How to tackle them and offer our insights and expertise? Before we start a disclaimer, the students that we talk about in these podcasts are fictitious. They are quite typical of students that we see in the book but counselling service. But any similarity to any particular person is entirely coincidental. My name is. Joe Middleton and I'm a counselor at Birkbeck. Today I'm talking to Camilla Mount, who is the head of access in the access and engagement department at Birkbeck. This is episode 6 adjusting to university life.
    
    This is a male student. He's in his mid 40s and has a long term partner and a son who is 15. He's returning to study a Masters and is doing it very much for the love of the subject. For the love of learning. As much as a desire to advance his career, he works full time in a fairly demanding job and is planning to study the Masters part time. He comes to us ahead of the start of his course, worried because he's afraid that it will be difficult for him to integrate the study into an already full life. He also highlights that he had some academic difficulties in his undergraduate. A degree which he took nearly 20 years ago, he's worried that he will re encounter these difficulties. These include social anxiety among people he's unfamiliar with, time management, procrastination. He's also suffering from a lack of confidence that he'll be able to perform well academically. His final degree at undergraduate level. Was and what he had hoped for involved in his reasons for returning to study is the wish to provide a good role model for his own son who's entering his exam period at this time.
    
    Gosh, it sounds like he's starting with already quite a full plate, doesn't it? Yeah, that sets slight alarm bells for me, but I will say recognise that. That's really quite typical of a lot of students who come to Birkbeck.
    
    I mean typical of lots of people that come to study at Birkbeck and just typical of life, really, we're always balancing a lot of things and a lot of responsibilities.
    
    Say the way that you or I might.
    
    I suppose.
    
    In to think with this student about what he's got on if you like, is starting to think realistically about how he manages his time and how he approaches his studies.
    
    I think that's a really good point I. A lot of people who come to Birkbeck maybe do so without a realistic expectation of what that's actually going to involve when they start in September. In the days is still quite long. There's still a lot of daylight around. You get to November and the nights are creeping in and it all becomes a little bit more challenging. My advice and what? We talked to our students a lot about is thinking about what is that going to look like two or three months into your studies. You know how many hours are you going to be needing to sit in the library? How many evenings a week are you going to need to get on the tube that takes you to Birkbeck rather than getting on the tube that takes you back home to your sofa and that can all be mapped out at this point? You know, before you've enrolled, you can already start to think about that and.
    
    Then I suppose encouraging a student like this to have those conversations with the people around. Tim as well, so that they're on the same page, they're aware of the realities of what he's he's beginning.
    
    Yeah, definitely. Your friends and family, the people that you interact with, they're the people that. Are going to. Be your rock. Really. When you're studying and not only are they going to be supportive, maybe they're the ones that can cook dinner, or they can, you know, help your son with revision. When you're maybe having to knuckle down yourself, they're also the people that are gonna sort of give you a kick to go on to that lecture and to help. Motivate you as well. Yeah, and I think. Is something about what support you have around you that has a real impact on your ability to stay in your studies, your ability to attain well and it's kind of for you to be able to go and talk to people quite frankly about that. So it might not be immediately obvious to your significant others to your friends and family that actually they're gonna play a really important role in your success at Birkbeck. So you need to be the person that approaches that and is able to talk to them and have. That conversation, as well as your. Employer. If you are in work and you do have any kind of job. But if it's a. Demanding job, you. Need to be upfront with the people that you're working with as well that you're carrying an extra load of responsibilities outside of work hours.
    
    Absolutely. And that's gonna require all sorts of thinking about what your boundaries are, the fact that you need to leave at a certain time to get to. Your lectures and. Yeah. And, you know, making inquiries. Weigh in advance about whether you're entitled to things like study leave or you know how you can take a bit of time to meet your assignment deadlines. You know when. If there's going to be any flexibility at work having those conversations early can actually really lower levels of anxiety about it later on.
    
    Yeah, definitely. And they're challenging conversations to have. It's always worth thinking about whether if you're a member of trade union, whether or not they can provide some support about having those conversations with employers around flexibility. Study leave and any kind of extra support, so it's it's kind of how much do you think you can ask for and even if it's just on. These certain days I'll need to be out of the office and need to be able to get to my lecture at. 6:00 that's something to think about. So this.
    
    Student that you've described, he seems to have a number of things going on. We've thought a little bit about the sort of time management and making space for his studies, which was one of his concerns. But he's mentioned a few others, hasn't he? The social anxiety with people he doesn't know this. He's gonna come across a lot of those as he begins a whole new course, procrastination, which I think we should. We do talk about in a different podcast and also hangover from his previous experience of studying in his undergraduate degree and it sounds to me. What I sort of pick up on is that he took quite a knock. To his confidence. In there and which he hasn't quite recovered from and. That taking this masters. Could be the means of recovering from that, but he's not at all sure about it.
    
    Yeah, I picked that up, but I think I mean, one of the first things to say is that he will certainly not be the only person starting at burgberg this autumn. With some of these anxieties, and there are people here and Joe, you'll be able to talk much more about.
    
    Where he can look for support. Once he's here, I think that's a really good point. Sorry to jump in on that, that there are the formal sort of sources of support like the well-being, services, counselling, mental health service so on and and the academic support as well that's that's very solid here at Birkbeck. But there's also the informal sources of support and by that I mean actually your peers. The other people on your course, can you begin to form working relationships with? And where you. Can lean on each other a little bit or, you know, help each other out with notes or revision or. And that's a a huge source of support potentially.
    
    Absolutely. And in conversations that I've had with Beck students, they're really good at this, and it should be really encouraged. He won't have had this in his undergraduate, but WhatsApp groups, those students start them right at the start of the year. If you're running late for a lecture, or if you're unable to make something, if you're worried about a deadline, instant messaging you can get in touch with people. Some of our academic departments. Are really good. Using Moodle to be able to create forums for people for their students while they're writing their assignments in order to be able to continue that disk. Fashion out of the classroom and I would like to think that there is a network of other students and places to go to be able to keep in touch with those students because unlike other universities, people will have other lives going on outside of their studies and you're not going to be constantly present on campus and so. It does take a little bit of initiative for Birkbeck students to create that network virtually through WhatsApp, through Facebook groups and other. Performs but, but actively encourages.
    
    That, and I think that raises quite an important point, because this student obviously has the busy life that you're talking about the the working life, the family life. So he might well be one of those students that sort of swoops in of an evening and swoops out again. A lot of the students I see in the counselling service. There's a sort of. Lament about that slightly, that they aren't able to interact more with their peers, and I think that's particularly difficult for some of. The younger students. Who are now coming to Birkbeck, who might expect a different experience at university and find that actually they're on courses with people who are have very busy full lives and they can feel a little bit lost? So if a younger student is experiencing some of those difficulties, that there is a certain amount of effort that they need to invest in forming networks, meeting peers, the students union is always available. Of course, the students.
    
    Union is available and the students union also partners with other colleges of the University of London, so. So US and UCL being the closest, so there's lots going on, but it does take that initiative and it does take that initial move by the individual to go out and look for it to go and make those connections. And I think that's a real challenge and there's no getting away from making that first approach with people that you might have only recently met can be really daunting. But they should realise that a lot of other people will be. In the same boat.
    
    So I wonder about this thorny problem of procrastination. It's very difficult to prioritise the study time. I'm often having conversations about partly what that's about, but also how to manage it. I'm aware that this student wants to create good study habits for himself, so he can also model them for his son, who might be having similar problems.
    
    Yeah, and the world's a really different place again, since he was last at university, there's a lot more out there that can really encourage that, that sort. Level of procrastination is the distractions online, and actually he might find that the one person that he can really learn from is his son, who has grown up and studied in an environment where there is a lot of online distraction where there's a lot of other opportunities to procrastinate and has been working with his teachers or his college tutors. To be able to look at ways of avoiding. That so yeah, you know, yes, be a good role model for your son, but also look at what what he can help you with as well. Learn from your learn from the child and also from your.
    
    Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    
    Peers, you know, have these. Conversations in your peer group.
    
    Procrastination is something that everyone struggles with, regardless of what job they're doing, what they're studying there almost needs to be an allowance for it and you know not to beat yourself up about it as well because.
    
    You said, right?
    
    Because otherwise it can really start to perpetuate other forms of anxiety. And but there are ways of of managing that and managing sort of time out and and looking at kind of what is realistic in terms of what you want to achieve in an evening.
    
    Absolutely. In a way that's almost the theme of this. Thinking realistically, rather than the wishful thinking. Or the the rather critical sort of expectations that we might have of ourselves, but thinking realistically about what is achievable and for for.
    
    You we often talk to younger students coming to Birkbeck who might have come straight from full time education where there are a lot of boundaries. People are helping them manage their time for much of the day. Yeah. And they have a lot of immediate deadlines that they're looking to to get done rather than longer term deadlines that are much harder to manage and much easier to procrastinate over and coming to higher education can feel a little bit like there's a big dropping off the Cliff edge of where that support kind of Peters out and where the opportunity to procrastinate. And not be and not manage your time effectively you can creep in. Big cultural shift.
    
    Isn't it to such independent study from being quite timetabled and structured?
    
    Yeah, it's huge.
    
    The other thing I think I'd say is to take into account that change is difficult and this is quite a big change that is coming as you embark on your studies and change can be exhausting and can bring about all sorts of worries and insecurities. And it can also just take a while to settle down into the new reality. So. Again, it's something about managing your expectation. And the normalness of change being really quite.
    
    Difficult. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if it's useful to also make the point that there will be ebbs and flows throughout the academic year and it kind of feeds into your point around adapting to that change and change to your routine. I touched on the kind of the seasons. You know, half joking. You know, we all start and the days are long and and and and warm and all the rest and it and everything feels completely manageable. But it just so happens that the point at which the seasons really do change and the weather becomes kind of miserable and it's dark, is around the time that quite often the first assignments start coming in as well, and you find that you're just about to come to Christmas and suddenly you've got the first big assignment, regardless of whether or not you're taking out a loan. Suddenly the dawning. The reality of the kind of financial commitment that you've made comes into play, and being aware that that is coming up and being able to put in some something to try and help cope with the. That would be really useful I think, and could really help.
    
    That's a really helpful point, absolutely.
    
    We run a mentoring program. We make a point of making sure that all those that are taking part in the mentoring program that they meet up before Christmas, that you're put in touch with your mentor at the point where actually things might start to feel a bit unmanageable. This is Beck Chat BK chat.
    
    BK Chat, which is a terrific enterprise and really valuable and helping peer-to-peer manage the studies and and manage the changes and the and the. Adjustment and there are.
    
    A number of. Schemes out there for both undergraduate and postgraduate students to look at. Well, you know, there's peer support but also other ways of being able to work with back alumni to be able to start licking your head and sometimes licking your head because if you're doing your masters part time then you could, you know, suddenly two years is coming to an end and you might be wanting to think about where that's going to take you so. Yeah. Well, thanks.
    
    Thank you really very much for. Being with us today and I I have some hope for this new student, my hope is that he'll be able to navigate these difficulties and and that actually the enthusiasm, he clearly seems to have for his subject will will carry him through the difficulties.
    
    Ohh absolutely. I think he's gonna thrive. I think that a lot of the things that he's coming with are things that a lot of people will be worried about. And maybe the final point is to say that he's doing it as much for the love of his subject as his desire to advance his career. And if there's a single piece of advice that we give to students who are thinking about coming to Birkbeck is choose a course that you've.
    
    As well.
    
    Love that you feel really strongly about it and you're really passionate about because that's what's going to sustain you through those dark winter nights and those three hour lectures and all the fun that you've got. Coming up, you're gonna be spending a lot of.
    
    Time with this subject, yes. Exactly, yeah. Well, thank you so much for joining us today.
    
    Yeah, my pleasure.
    
    Thank you for listening to the mind. Your mind podcast brought to you by the Birkbeck Counselling Service and bracket productions.
