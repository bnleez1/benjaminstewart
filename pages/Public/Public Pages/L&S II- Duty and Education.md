# Schedule

> [!important] I will be out of the office from March 28, 2023 until April 5, 2023. Continue to work on what we have discussed in class and let me know if you have questions (via the VC) or need feedback (mention me as a comment in Word).
## March 27, 2023 - April 4, 2023
## Instructions
- Brainstorm a list of potential questions related to _duty_ and _education_ (whole group).
    
    How should students be present in class?
    
    Why must students be respectful with the teacher?
    
    What are some students’ responsibilities?
    
    Why do students have to attend classes on time?
    
    Which characteristics do students want teachers to have?
    
    Why does having a good education depend not only on the teachers but also the students?
    
    When should students have a break after having an exam period?
    
    How should students and teachers show empathy during class?
    
    How should students take advantage of their free time between classes?
    
    What learning strategies (e.g., reading strategies, etc.) should teachers know?
    
    Where (or how) should students study before an exam?
    
    Why should students ask for feedback?
    
- From the brainstorming list of potential questions, find three classmates who are not in your team and find those who share your opinion and someone who does not share your opinion. Based on your conversations, complete [the Excel spreadsheet](https://eduuaa-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/lee_stewart_edu_uaa_mx/ERgKwHpELNdGrBcQ1N79sNwB9I6xYTfgbHUGS8IhyzpdwQ?e=k7WPuP). Highlight the cells in the Excel spreadsheet the responses from your classmates who agree with you (light green) and those who share a difference of opinion (light red).
    
      
    
- Add team information to your [shared Word document in week 10](https://eduuaa-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/lee_stewart_edu_uaa_mx/Enr-KF3zBdNEjaHJZ2aLihABUMXFKCtpsg4AwnRJ33PvxA?e=4gyy8y).
    
    Add an image ([DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/), etc.) to your Word document.
    
    Ask your teammates the same questions you asked your classmates who are not in your team.
    
    Provide an individual summary (one per team member) of all the responses in your team Word document (150-200 words with at least four sentences). Highlight the key ideas from your summary and condense into two sentences, adding it to the spreadsheet (column K).
    
    [Create a flip video](http://flip.com/498c8c7e) that summarizes and explains the responses you received from classmates and others that you interviewed this week. Speak for 8-10 minutes and include a video of yourself speaking in English. Your video should include explanations of both the responses from your classmates and your own opinions.
    
    Convert your team Word document to a PDF and upload to [the VC assignment](https://aulavirtual.uaa.mx/mod/assign/view.php?id=341534).
    
## April 5, 2023
Complete the [Duty and education interviews assignment in the VC](https://aulavirtual.uaa.mx/mod/assign/view.php?id=341534).
Open the [duty and education survey Excel spreadsheet](https://eduuaa-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/lee_stewart_edu_uaa_mx/EXbrcLVVe7ZJjDCUxtTnyeQBd9V3tVMAnHZbTRm8ANBAnw?e=KbrO4H).
- ChatGPT search term, “What makes a good teacher and what are five key duties they must adhere to?” - Bing search April 5, 2023 8:20 AM.
    
    A good teacher should have a grounding in pedagogy, establish their own standards for success, build a community of democracy and respect in the classroom, participate in a community of teachers who inspire them to keep learning, shifting, and improving, and fully commit to their profession and their classrooms¹.
    
    Some qualities of a good teacher include skills in communication, listening, collaboration, adaptability, empathy, and patience².
    
    The duties and responsibilities of a teacher include demonstrating the ability to perform teaching or other responsibilities, including good work habits, reliability, punctuality and follow-through on commitments; providing and accepting evaluative feedback in a professional manner; creating and maintaining a positive and safe learning environment³.
    
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
