## MEAL Plan Synopsis (body paragraph)
When writing a thesis paper, there are three main types of paragraphs: introductory, body, and conclusion paragraphs. An introductory paragraph sets the stage with a thesis statement, while body paragraphs develop the main ideas with evidence and analysis. Conclusion paragraphs summarize the thesis and main points. In a five-paragraph essay, these types are used, except for transitional paragraphs, which are specific to longer papers. Each paragraph type plays a crucial role in structuring the thesis and ensuring clarity and coherence in the argument.
The MEAL plan (Main idea, Evidence, Analysis, Linking) is a structured approach to writing effective body paragraphs. It begins with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by evidence sentences that provide factual support. Analysis sentences interpret the evidence, explaining its relevance to the main idea. Finally, linking sentences transition to the next paragraph or summarize the current one. This method ensures that each paragraph is cohesive and contributes to the overall argument of the thesis.

    Question: What hobbies have you picked up recently?
    
    A recent hobby that I chose was yoga. I practice yoga three times per week:
    
    . On Tuesdays and Thursdays I go at 6:00 PM and on Saturday, I go at 8:30 AM. Sometimes, I go on Wednesdays, where Somadhi offers Hatha Yoga with more advanced Yoga positions for those with more experience. Although some of the positions are difficult, overall, Yoga relaxes me and allows me to sleep better. I enjoy the challenge of completing more advanced positions as I gradually gain strength and balance. Yoga helps build mind, body, and soul and give me a new outlook on my daily and weekly routine.
