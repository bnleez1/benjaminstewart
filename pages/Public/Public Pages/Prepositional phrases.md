**Basic Structure:**

Preposition + Modifier(s) (optional) + Noun/Pronoun (object)
```
**Examples:**

    → “from Mexico” modifies “girl” (Which girl?)
    
### 2. **Adverbial Prepositional Phrases**
These modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They answer questions like **How? When? Where? Why?** and **To what extent?**
**Examples:**
- _He ran **across the field**._
    
    → “across the field” modifies “ran” (Where?)

## Prepositional Phrases in Sentence Structure
A prepositional phrase can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. Its placement can affect sentence rhythm but not necessarily meaning.
**Examples:**
- _At the end of the day, we were exhausted._ (Beginning)
- _We were, at the end of the day, exhausted._ (Middle – uncommon)

## Avoiding Common Mistakes
1. **Do not confuse prepositions with conjunctions.**
    - _Correct:_ I stayed **after dinner**.
    - _Incorrect:_ I stayed **after** he left. (“after” is a subordinating conjunction here, not a preposition.)
2. **Watch for dangling prepositions in formal writing.**
    - _Informal:_ This is the book I was looking for.
    - _Formal:_ This is the book **for which** I was looking.
3. **Avoid redundancy.**
    - _Incorrect:_ Return **back** to the store.
    - _Correct:_ Return to the store.

## Prepositional Phrases vs. Prepositions Alone
A **preposition** by itself is not a phrase. It must be followed by an object.
**Not a phrase:** _in, on, at, about_
**Phrase:** _in the house, on the table, at the beach, about her decision_
