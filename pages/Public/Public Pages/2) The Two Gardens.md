In a small village, there were two houses side by side. An old woman named Elara lived in one house. A young family lived in the other house. The family had a father, a mother, and two small children, a boy named Sam and a girl named Lily.
Elara’s family was her garden. She had no husband or children. Her plants were her family. Every morning, she woke up early. She gave water to her flowers. She talked to her tomato plants. She had red roses, yellow sunflowers, and purple lavender. Her garden was beautiful and very organized. Every plant was in the perfect place. It was a very quiet and neat garden.
Next door, the young family’s garden was very different. It was not quiet. It was full of life and noise. Sam and Lily played in the garden every day. They had a small swing and a blue ball. They sometimes kicked the ball into the flowers. Their father had a small vegetable patch, but it was messy. Their mother tried to plant flowers, but the children often ran over them. Their garden was not organized, but it was full of laughter.
Elara watched them from her window. She did not like the noise. She did not like the mess. “They do not take care of their garden,” she thought. “A family should be neat and organized. My garden family is perfect.”
One sunny afternoon, Sam and Lily were playing. Their blue ball bounced high into the air. It went over the fence and landed right in the middle of Elara’s red roses. The children were scared. They knew Elara loved her flowers.
Sam and Lily went to Elara’s door. They knocked with small, nervous hands. Elara opened the door. She looked down at them. She did not smile.
“Our ball is in your garden,” whispered Lily. “We are very sorry.”
Elara looked at her perfect roses. The blue ball was a strange object in her neat garden. She was angry for a moment. But then she looked at the children’s faces. They looked very sad and very scared. They were a family. They were a team. They came to her together.
Elara’s heart felt something new. Her garden was beautiful, but it was silent. Her flowers were perfect, but they could not talk or laugh. They could not say “sorry.”
She walked slowly into her garden. She picked up the blue ball. She gave it back to Sam.
“It is okay,” she said, and for the first time, she smiled at them. “But you must be more careful.”
“We will!” said Sam.
The next day, Elara brought a small basket to the family’s house. In the basket were red tomatoes from her garden. The mother was very surprised and happy.
“Thank you, Elara!” she said.
From that day on, things were different. Elara did not mind the noise from the next-door garden. Sometimes, she would watch the children play and smile. And sometimes, Sam and Lily would bring Elara a small, messy flower they picked from their own garden.
Elara learned that her quiet, organized garden was one type of family. The noisy, messy garden next door was another type of family. Both were full of love.
