# Monday
- Summarize weekly reading into a simple weekly calendar.
- Alex’s alarm rings at 7:00 AM. He has a 9:00 AM “Grammar in Context I” class across campus, so he needs to hurry. After a quick breakfast at the cafeteria, he walks to the humanities building. The campus is huge, and he still sometimes gets lost. His first class is a lecture. The professor talks for 50 minutes, and Alex has to take notes quickly. It’s very different from his high school classes. After his lecture, he has a two-hour break. He decides to go to the library to review his notes and work on an upcoming assignment. The library is his favorite place; it’s quiet and full of resources. He knows that to be a successful student, he has to be disciplined.
- Monday summary
    
    Alex begins his week by adapting to the demanding pace and independence required in university classes while exploring campus resources like the library.
    
    By midweek, Alex is getting into his routine. He has three classes today: statistics, world history, and a mandatory physical education class. The statistics class is his most difficult course. The concepts are abstract and require a lot of concentration. He spends his afternoon in a study group, working on homework problems with classmates. This is very helpful. They explain things to each other and share notes. After studying, he goes to soccer practice. Balancing academics and extracurricular activities is hard, but Alex knows it's an important part of the university experience. It teaches time management and teamwork. He feels tired, but also productive.
    
    Alex finds his academic rhythm by attending multiple classes, working with other classmates, and realizing that schoolwork with extracurricular activities is important to be successful.

    > [!important] Summarize in your drawings the main points and details needed to retell the story.
    
    ### **Part A – The Arrival**
    
    The small boat rocked violently as the waves pushed it toward the dark silhouette of the island. Every crash of the water against the wooden sides made Maria’s heart jump. The mist was so thick that the coastline appeared blurred, like a watercolor painting left out in the rain. The cries of seagulls echoed above, though the birds themselves were only shadows darting in and out of the fog.
    
    Maria, clutching her soaked backpack, tried to keep her balance as the boat tilted sharply to one side. The cliffs ahead rose straight from the water like jagged teeth biting into the gray sky. At the very top, she thought she saw the outline of something unusual—perhaps a tower, or maybe just a crooked tree bent by the endless wind. The others in the boat whispered nervously, pointing at shapes that might have been rocks, or perhaps something watching them.
    
    As they drew closer, the air smelled strongly of salt and seaweed, mixed with a faint metallic tang, as if iron had been left to rust nearby. The waves finally calmed as they reached a narrow cove, and the boat scraped against the shore with a sound that made everyone wince. For a long moment, no one moved, staring at the cliffs that loomed above them, waiting for someone to step first onto the wet sand.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Part B – The Forest Path**
    
    Once on land, the group discovered a narrow trail that disappeared beneath enormous ferns. The leaves were so wide that two people could stand beneath one like an umbrella. The forest canopy above was so thick that sunlight struggled to touch the ground, and the air felt heavy, as if it hadn’t moved in years. The path itself was soft and damp, sinking slightly with every step, as though the earth were alive and breathing beneath their feet.
    
    Strange vines curled around tree trunks, and some glowed faintly in the shadows, as if painted with fireflies. Maria brushed one with her finger and quickly pulled her hand back; it felt warmer than a plant should. Every step made the forest hum with life: the cry of distant birds with sharp, metallic voices, the croak of hidden frogs that sounded almost like laughter, and the sudden rush of wings as dark shapes darted overhead.
    
    The smell of moss was thick in the air, mixed with the sweet perfume of unknown flowers whose colors seemed brighter than natural—violet petals edged with gold, orange blossoms streaked with red. A butterfly with glass-like wings fluttered past, reflecting tiny sparks of light. The group walked in silence, each listening to the strange music of the forest, feeling both wonder and unease.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Part C – The Abandoned Village**
    
    The path eventually opened into a wide clearing, and the group froze at the sight before them. Wooden huts leaned on one another like tired old men, their roofs sagging under the weight of vines and time. Some doors hung crooked on rusted hinges, while others had fallen completely, revealing dark interiors filled with shadows. Broken clay pots lay scattered in the grass, some still holding traces of dried seeds or grains that crumbled to dust when touched.
    
    In the center of the village stood a stone well, its edges carved with spirals and stars that were smooth in some places and sharp in others, as if recently touched. The carvings seemed to shimmer in the sunlight, though perhaps it was only the imagination. Nearby, a wooden swing hung from a branch, moving slowly back and forth despite the air being perfectly still. The squeak of the rope was the only sound, and it made the silence feel even heavier.
    
    The group exchanged uneasy looks. The village felt abandoned but not empty, as if eyes were watching from the huts or from the forest beyond. A faded piece of cloth clung to one doorway, decorated with symbols they couldn’t understand. There was no sign of people, no smoke, no footsteps, yet everything suggested that life had once been here, and perhaps had ended suddenly. The place carried the weight of stories left untold.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Part D – The Tower on the Hill**
    
    Climbing the last stretch of the path, the group reached a hill crowned with a stone tower. From a distance it had looked tall and solid, but up close it was cracked and weathered, as if lightning had struck it long ago. Ivy crawled up its sides like green veins, creeping into the cracks as though trying to hold the structure together. The doorway stood wide open, dark as a mouth waiting to swallow them whole.
    
    Inside, the air smelled of dust and old stone. A spiral staircase curled upward into darkness, each step worn smooth as though countless feet had climbed it over centuries. The walls near the entrance were covered with strange symbols carved deep into the stone: circles within circles, arrows pointing skyward, and an eye staring outward that seemed almost alive. When Maria ran her fingers over one of the carvings, she felt a strange vibration, like a heartbeat beneath the rock.
    
    The wind howled across the hilltop, whistling through the cracks of the tower. From time to time it made a low, moaning sound, like the tower itself was breathing. Birds circled above, crying sharply before vanishing into the clouds. As the group stood at the entrance, staring up at the spiral staircase, they felt that stepping inside would not only change their day but perhaps their lives. The tower seemed less like a ruin and more like a secret waiting to be unlocked.
