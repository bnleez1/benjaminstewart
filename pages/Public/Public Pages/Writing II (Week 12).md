Also, drivers who attend driving school experience less automotive accidents during their first three years of driving (). Therefore, the government should subsidize autonomous vehicle manafactures if they want to reduce car accidents and improve the safety of its drivers._

## Friday
- Finish reworking the seven sentences from yesterday's activity.
- Similar to Monday's activity, based on the topic you chose from the [list of topics for constructing an argumentative essay,](https://benjaminlstewart.com/list-of-topics-for-constructing-an-argumentative-essay/)create one paragraph (below the two activities that we began yesterday) by creating a topic sentence based on the counterclaim provided and then have three classmates create two evidence sentences and one analysis sentence. Consider the following:
    - No cell phones or other devices may be used. Help each other with grammar and vocabulary and ask me as well.
    - Write one paragraph _without_ beginning a sentence on a new line.
    - The topic sentence should begin with the main clause.
    - The topic sentence should begin with a noun phrase.
    - The topic sentence should not have a linking verb in the main clause (e.g., "to be", etc.)
    - The topic sentence should be a complex sentence with either a relative clause and/or a subordinating clause.
    - The two sentences after the topic sentence should be evidence sentences (citations not required) and should be either a complex, compound, or complex-compound sentence.
    - The two evidence sentences should provide examples, details, or facts related to the topic sentence.
    - The fourth sentence should be an analysis sentence that connects the evidence to the topic sentence and should be either a complex, compound, or complex-compound sentence.
    - Below your completed paragraph, write the names of those who wrote their respective sentences.
- Example
    - **Counterclaim**: Homeschooling can isolate children and may not provide a balanced education.
    - Homeschooling isolates children and does not provide a balance education because school is not just an academic experience but also a social one. Students who are learning different subjects like math and science often rely on each other to work together to complete different tasks. Moreover, social events outside of school helps students to learn how to relate to each other and they learn how to get along in a variety of settings. As a result, learning how to form relationships is a skill set that helps learners become a more productive member of society.
