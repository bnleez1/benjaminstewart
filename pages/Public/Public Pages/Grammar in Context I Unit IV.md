# **Pasado, Presente y Futuro (Past, Present, and Future)**
# Stage 1 - Desired Results
## Established Goals
- **Communication:**
- Interpersonal Communication: I can communicate and exchange information, feelings, and opinions on a variety of familiar topics using phrases and simple sentences.
- Presentational Communication: I can tell a story about my life, activities, and events using a series of simple sentences.
- **Connections:**
- Making Connections: I can use the language to investigate, explain, and reflect on the concept of personal growth and life choices.
- **Comparisons:**
- Cultural Comparisons: I can use the language to investigate, explain, and reflect on the concept of identity and life stages in the cultures studied and my own.
### Transfer
Learners will be able to independently use their learning to create a personal portfolio and participate in a mock "scholarship" or "internship" interview. In this interview, they will need to reflect on significant past experiences, describe skills they developed, explain how these experiences have shaped their current preferences and decisions, and articulate their hopes and concrete plans for the future.
### Meaning
### Understandings:
Learners will understand that...
- Our past experiences and abilities shape who we are today and the choices we make.
- Making thoughtful decisions involves comparing options and understanding our own preferences.
- Our identity is not static; it is a story we write by connecting our past, present, and future.
### Essential Questions:
- How do our past stories define our present selves?
- How do we make choices that align with who we want to become?
- What is the difference between a dream and a plan?
### Acquisition
### _Learners will know…_
### **Learners will know...**
- **Week 1 (Experiencias anteriores):** The preterite tense for narrating completed past actions; vocabulary for life events (birth, travel, achievements).
- **Week 2 (Habilidades pasadas):** The imperfect tense for describing past conditions, routines, and abilities; phrases for expressing what one could or used to be able to do (_podía_, _sabía_).
- **Week 3 (Tomando decisiones):** Comparative and superlative structures (_más/menos que_, _tan...como_, _el/la mejor_); vocabulary for expressing opinions and preferences.
- **Week 4 (Hacer arreglos futuros):** The simple future tense and the _ir a + infinitive_ structure to talk about plans, intentions, and hopes.
### _Students will be skilled at…_
- Narrating a sequence of past events.
- Describing what they were like and what they could do in the past.
- Comparing two or more things and justifying a choice.
- Making arrangements and talking about their future goals.
# Stage 2 - Assessment Evidence

> [!important] All graded assignments are listed below.
## Performance Task:
- **"Mi Trayectoria" Portfolio & Interview:**
- Students will first create a simple portfolio (digital or physical) with artifacts representing their past, present, and future (e.g., a photo from a past trip, a list of current favorite things, a goal for next year).
- They will then participate in a one-on-one interview where they will use their portfolio as a guide to:
1. Tell the story of a significant past experience (using the preterite).
2. Describe a skill they had when they were younger (using the imperfect).
3. Explain a choice they recently made by comparing options.
4. Outline a plan they have for the upcoming year (using the future tense).
- The task will be assessed with a rubric that evaluates narrative coherence, correct tense usage, and task completion.
## Other Evidence:
- **"Biografía Corta":** Students write a short biography of an admired person, focusing on key past events (Week 1).
- **Quizzes:** Quizzes focusing on the distinction between preterite and imperfect, comparatives, and future tense conjugations.
- **"Then vs. Now" Presentation:** A short presentation comparing a skill or hobby they had as a child to their skills now (Week 2).
- **"Decision Dilemma" Role-Play:** In pairs, students debate the pros and cons of two options (e.g., which movie to see, where to go on vacation) and make a decision (Week 3).
- **"New Year's Resolutions"** A written list of future plans and hopes (Week 4).
# Stage 3 - Learning Plan
## Learning Plan (WHERETO
### **Week 1: Experiencias anteriores / Can describe past experiences**
- **W (Where/Why):** Introduce the final portfolio and interview task. Explain that our life story is built on key moments.
- **H (Hook):** Show a short, animated biography of a well-known figure (like Frida Kahlo or Lionel Messi) highlighting major life events.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Use personal timelines, storytelling, and sequential art (comic strips) to introduce and practice the preterite tense for narration.
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students identify three key events in their own lives and write a sentence about each, putting them in chronological order.
- **E (Evaluate):** Students write a short paragraph about a memorable vacation or birthday.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide a list of key event verbs. Challenge advanced students to include more details and descriptive language.
- **O (Organize):** Start with high-frequency preterite verbs, build to sequencing events, and culminate in short narrative paragraphs.
### **Week 2: Habilidades pasadas / Can describe past abilities**
- **W:** Connect past abilities to personal growth. How have the things we could do in the past led to our skills today?
- **H (Hook):** Bring in childhood toys or show pictures of them (e.g., a tricycle, building blocks, a simple instrument) and ask "What could you do with this?"
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Use "before and after" pictures and scenarios to introduce the imperfect tense for descriptions and routines. Contrast its use with the preterite.
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students complete the sentence "Cuando era niño/a, yo..." (When I was a child, I...) with five different descriptions or abilities.
- **E (Evaluate):** A short quiz on when to use preterite vs. imperfect.
- **T (Tailor):** Use Venn diagrams to visually compare the two past tenses.
- **O (Organize):** Introduce the imperfect for description, then directly contrast it with the preterite for action through storytelling.
### **Week 3: Tomando decisiones / Can compare people and things**
- **W:** Frame the week's learning around how we use our past experiences and abilities to make choices in the present.
- **H (Hook):** Present a fun "Would you rather...?" (¿Qué prefieres...?) scenario with visual aids (e.g., living in the mountains or on the beach).
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Use product catalogs, restaurant menus, and top-ten lists to introduce and practice comparative and superlative structures.
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students work in groups to plan a class party, debating and deciding on the best music, food, and activities by comparing options.
- **E (Evaluate):** Students write a short paragraph explaining which of two phones, cars, or vacation spots they would choose and why.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide clear formulas and sentence starters for comparisons.
- **O (Organize):** Start with simple comparisons (_más...que_), move to equality (_tan...como_), and finish with superlatives.
### **Week 4: Hacer arreglos futuros / Can make future arrangements**
- **W:** Position this as the final step: looking forward. How do we turn our decisions and hopes into concrete plans?
- **H (Hook):** Show a short video about a major upcoming event in a Spanish-speaking city (like the preparations for a festival or a new construction project).
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Use calendars, planners, and "bucket lists" to practice talking about future plans with _ir a + infinitive_ and the simple future tense.
- **R (Rethink/Reflect):** Students create a personal "road map" for the next five years, plotting out key goals they hope to achieve.
- **E (Evaluate):** The "Mi Trayectoria" portfolio and interview will serve as the summative assessment for the unit.
- **T (Tailor):** Differentiate between _ir a + infinitive_ for near, certain plans and the future tense for more distant hopes or predictions.
- **O (Organize):** The week is dedicated to reviewing all unit concepts and preparing for the final performance task.
