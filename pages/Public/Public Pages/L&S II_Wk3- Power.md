- ChatGPT search term, "Summarize the concept of power among minority groups."
    - The concept of power among minority groups refers to the unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and influence in society between majority and minority groups. Minority groups typically have less power than the majority group, which leads to marginalization, discrimination, and unequal treatment. However, minority groups can also assert their power through collective action, such as activism and advocacy, to challenge the status quo and achieve greater equality. The concept highlights the importance of acknowledging and addressing power imbalances in order to create a more just and equitable society.
