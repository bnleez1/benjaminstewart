    Carlos and Emma are brother and sister. They live in a small town in Mexico. Carlos is twenty-two years old, and he works in a supermarket.

    ---

After breakfast, Carlos puts on his uniform, says goodbye to his family, and walks to the supermarket. He usually starts work at 7:00.
    
    Emma usually wakes up later than Carlos. She usually wakes up at 6:45, but sometimes she wakes up later if she is very tired. She always eats breakfast with her father. She usually eats cereal with milk and a piece of fruit. Emma never drinks coffee because she doesn’t like it. After breakfast, she brushes her teeth, prepares her backpack, and leaves for school. She usually walks with her best friend, Sofia, because Sofia lives near her house.
    
    ---
    
    ## School and Work
    
    At the supermarket, Carlos always works in the morning. He usually puts food on the shelves, helps customers, and answers questions. Sometimes he works at the cash register and takes the customers’ money. He enjoys his job because he often talks to many people. Carlos usually finishes work at 2:00 in the afternoon.
    
    At school, Emma has six classes every day. She usually studies English, math, science, history, Spanish, and art. Her favorite subject is English because she likes learning new words and reading short stories. She often studies with her friend Sofia in the library during breaks. They sometimes eat lunch in the cafeteria, but they often eat lunch outside when the weather is nice. Emma usually finishes school at 2:30 in the afternoon.
    
    ---
    
    ## Afternoon
    
    After work, Carlos usually eats lunch with his coworkers in the small cafeteria inside the supermarket. He often eats tacos, rice, and beans. Sometimes he brings food from home in a lunchbox. After lunch, Carlos usually goes home and rests. He sometimes takes a short nap because he feels tired.
    
    Emma usually goes home after school. She often eats lunch at home with her mother and father. Her mother usually cooks soup, chicken, or pasta. After lunch, Emma helps clean the kitchen. She sometimes helps her mother wash the dishes, but not always. After that, Emma usually studies in her bedroom. She always does her homework in the afternoon because she wants to have free time in the evening.
    
    ---
    
    ## Evening
    
    In the evening, Carlos and Emma usually spend time with their family. Carlos often helps his father repair things around the house. Sometimes he goes shopping with his mother. He sometimes plays soccer with his friends in the park. When he plays soccer, he usually comes home at 8:00. If he does not play soccer, he often watches TV or reads the newspaper in the living room.
    
    Emma usually studies for about an hour in the evening. She often reviews vocabulary for her English class or practices writing. Sometimes she listens to music in English because it helps her learn new words. After studying, she usually watches TV with her brother and parents. She never watches TV alone because she likes being with her family.
    
    The family usually eats dinner together at 8:30. They often eat rice, beans, and tortillas, and sometimes they eat chicken or fish. During dinner, they usually talk about their day. Carlos sometimes tells funny stories about customers at the supermarket, and Emma often talks about her teachers and her friends.
    
    ---
    
    ## Night
    
    After dinner, Emma usually takes a shower and prepares her backpack for the next day. She sometimes reads a book before bed. She usually goes to sleep at 10:00 because she needs to wake up early for school.
    
    Carlos usually takes a shower after dinner, too. Sometimes he checks his phone or sends messages to his friends. He often feels tired, so he usually goes to sleep at 10:30. He never goes to sleep later than 11:00, because he always needs to wake up at 6:00 the next morning.
    
    ---
    
    ## Weekends
    
    On weekends, Carlos and Emma’s routines are a little different. Carlos sometimes works on Saturday mornings, but never on Sundays. If he doesn’t work, he usually plays soccer with his friends or goes to the market with his parents. He often helps clean the house, too.
    
    Emma usually studies on Saturday mornings. She often does her homework early, so she has free time in the afternoon. Sometimes she goes shopping with her mother, and sometimes she visits Sofia. On Sundays, Emma and her family always go to church in the morning. In the afternoon, they sometimes visit their grandparents.
    
    ---
    
    ## Reflection
    
    Although Carlos and Emma are different ages, and their routines are not the same, they always live together and spend time with their family. Carlos works hard at the supermarket, and Emma studies hard at school. They usually help their parents and spend evenings together. Their daily routines are busy, but they are happy because they always support each other.
