[[Writing II (Week 17)]]
# Make up exam instructions
For those wanting to make up one of the three essays that you wrote this semester, you may do so by confirming via Microsoft Teams by June 5, 2024 that you wish to resubmit an essay and state which essay you want to make up: expository essay, persuasive essay, or argumentative essay (only one essay may be made up). When I receive your request, I will create a shared Google Doc where you are expected to make all changes within this same document.
I will schedule an in-person class on June 14, 2024 to answer any general questions about text format, how to write a good essay (depending on the type of essay you are writing), APA, etc. and will allow you make any final changes by June 17, 2024.
Not individual feedback will be provided.
Your originality score for your final essay should be between 90%-100%.
  
# During first week of exams - June 10, 2024 through June 14, 2024
