_A Module on Communicating Hobbies and Interests_
---
### **Stage 1: Desired Results**
This module moves beyond simple statements of preference to explore how we talk about our passions. We will examine the language we use to describe our hobbies and interests, not just as a way to share information, but as a fundamental tool for building rapport and revealing our identities.
**Established Goals**
- Learners will be able to express hobbies and interests effectively to communicate personal passions and foster social connections.
**Enduring Understanding**
- Students will understand that expressing hobbies and interests effectively involves choosing precise language to clearly communicate personal passions and foster meaningful social connections. 1
**Essential Questions**
- How does talking about our hobbies reveal who we are?
- What is the difference between simply _liking_ something and being _passionate_ about it, and how does our language show this?
- How can the way we describe our interests build a bridge to connect with another person?
- Why is saying “I’ve baked hundreds of loaves of bread” more powerful than saying “I like baking”?
### **Stage 2: The Reading**
### **Beyond 'I Like': Communicating Passion and Fostering Connection**
What do you do for fun? It’s a simple question, but the answer can be a powerful act of self-revelation. The hobbies and interests we cultivate are more than just activities to pass the time; they are expressions of our personality, our curiosity, and our passions. When we share them, we are offering someone a window into who we are. However, to make that view compelling, we must choose our words carefully. Simply stating, “I like movies,” does little to build a connection. But describing how you’ve meticulously collected every film by a certain director or have attended a film festival every year for a decade—that tells a story. This chapter explores how using precise language, particularly the present perfect tense, can transform a simple statement about a hobby into a meaningful conversation that forges real social bonds.
**The Grammar of Experience: Using the Present Perfect**
When we talk about our hobbies, we are rarely speaking of a single, finished event. We are speaking of an activity that started in the past and continues to be relevant to who we are in the present. This is precisely the function of the **present perfect tense**. It is the grammar of life experience. It connects the past to the present, making it the ideal tool for describing the accumulated journey of a hobby.
Contrast the simple past with the present perfect. “I played guitar in a band in college” places the activity firmly in the past; it’s a finished story. But saying, “I’**ve played** guitar since I was a teenager,” signals that this skill and passion are still part of your current identity. The present perfect opens the door for follow-up questions and deeper conversation. It says, "This is part of who I am now."
Consider this exchange at a community meet-up:
Liam: This is a great event. So, what do you do when you’re not attending things like this?
Chloe: Well, I’ve gotten really into urban gardening lately.
Liam: Oh, cool! Have you grown anything interesting?
Chloe: I have! I’ve had a lot of success with herbs on my balcony. I just bought a beautiful new ceramic pot for my basil plant. What about you?
Liam: That’s awesome. I don’t have a green thumb, but I have collected vinyl records for years. I have spent a fortune on rare LPs!
Chloe’s use of “I’ve gotten into” and Liam’s “I’ve collected” establishes their hobbies as ongoing parts of their lives. Their use of specific **hobby-related items** (“ceramic pot,” “rare LPs”) adds a layer of authenticity and detail that makes their interests tangible and real.
**The Power of Precision: From Vague to Vivid**
The enduring understanding for this topic emphasizes "choosing precise language." This is where we move from being merely understood to being truly engaging. Vague language forces your listener to do the hard work of asking clarifying questions. Precise language, rich with specific nouns and active verbs, paints a picture and invites the listener into your world. This concept is central to effective interpersonal communication. Theories like Uncertainty Reduction Theory suggest that when we first meet someone, our main goal is to reduce uncertainty about them (Berger & Calabrese, 1975). By providing clear, specific details about our passions, we make ourselves more knowable and relatable, which accelerates the process of building rapport.
Sharing a hobby is an act of self-disclosure. The level of detail you provide signals your willingness to connect. Look at the difference:
- **Vague:** "I'm into photography."
- **Precise:** "I **have been** passionate about photography for about five years. I started with my phone, but I'**ve recently upgraded** to a mirrorless camera with a versatile **zoom lens**. I **have taken** thousands of photos, mostly of landscapes during my hikes."
The second version is infinitely more compelling. It provides a timeline, shows progression, uses specific vocabulary (“mirrorless camera,” “zoom lens”), and links the hobby to another activity (hiking). This specificity doesn't just communicate a fact; it communicates passion and invites a whole range of potential follow-up questions, fostering the "meaningful social connections" we seek.
Sara: Your profile said you're into gaming. Have you played anything good recently?
Tom: Definitely. I’ve always loved strategy games. For the past month, I’ve been completely absorbed in ‘Dune: Spice Wars.’ I have spent hours optimizing my resource production. The graphics card on my PC is getting a real workout.
Sara: I'm not a huge strategy gamer, but I appreciate the dedication! I’ve been playing ‘Stray’—the game where you play as a cat. It's much more relaxed. The puzzle mechanics are brilliant.
Tom’s use of the present perfect continuous (“I’ve been completely absorbed”) emphasizes the recent intensity of his hobby, and his mention of a specific item (“graphics card”) signals his level of investment. Sara can then connect on the shared ground of gaming, even if their specific tastes differ. This is the foundation of a real connection.
In conclusion, talking about our hobbies is a critical social skill. It relies on a partnership between grammar and vocabulary. The present perfect tense provides the framework to discuss our experiences, while precise, vivid vocabulary fills in the details that convey our passion. By mastering this combination, we can move beyond simple statements and use conversations about our interests to build lasting, meaningful connections.
