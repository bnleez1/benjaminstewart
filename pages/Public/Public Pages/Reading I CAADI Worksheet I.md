### My Reading for Joy Checklist
Hello, fellow reader! This checklist is your personal guide to exploring English through stories, articles, and books you love. It’s not a test! The goal is to enjoy the process, notice your progress, and discover new ideas.
---
### **Phase 1: Before You Read**
- `☐` **Choose Your Adventure:** I picked ==something I== _==want==_ ==to read. (e.g., a blog post about my hobby, a comic book, a chapter of a novel, a news article about a topic I like).==
- `☐` **Set a Simple Goal:** My goal today is ==to read for a specific time or amount. (e.g., "I will read for 15 minutes," or "I will read 5 pages.")==
- `☐` **Get Comfortable:** I have found a quiet, comfortable place to relax and read: ==where?==
- `☐` **Make a Quick Prediction:** Based on the title and any pictures, I think this ==will be about...==
---
### **Phase 2: While You Read**
- `☐` **Focus on the Flow:** I am reading for the main idea and overall feeling. I will not stop for every single word I don't know.
- `☐` **Guess Like a Detective:** If I see an unknown word, I will try to guess its meaning from the other words around it (the context). I will only look it up if I can't understand the whole sentence.
- `☐` **Notice Connections:** I will pay attention if the reading reminds me of something in my own life, a movie I saw, or something else I know.
- `☐` **Just Enjoy It!** I am relaxing and letting myself get lost in the text.
