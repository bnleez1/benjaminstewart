# **Unit 1: Who Am I? Who Are We?**
# Stage 1 - Desired Results
## Established Goals
This four-week unit introduces students to the fundamentals of personal information in English. Students will learn to identify main and specific ideas in texts, acquire vocabulary through context, and apply these skills to understand and share information about themselves, their families, friends, and roommates.
### Transfer
Students will be able to independently use their learning to 1) introduce themselves and others in various social contexts, 2) complete forms and documents that require personal information, 3) understand and engage in basic conversations about personal identity and relationships.
### Meaning
### Understandings:
Students will understand that:
- Sharing personal information is a key part of forming connections.
- The way we describe ourselves and our relationships reveals what we value.
- Effective communication involves both understanding the main points and the important details.
- We can often understand new words by looking at the words and sentences around them.
### Essential Questions:
- How do we define ourselves?
- What makes a family?
- What does it mean to be a good friend or roommate?
- How can we understand others better?
### Acquisition
### _Learners will know…_
Students will know:
- Vocabulary related to personal information (name, age, nationality, etc.).
- Vocabulary for family members, friends, and roommates.
- Basic sentence structures for asking and answering questions about personal information.
### _Students will be skilled at…_
Students will be skilled at:
- Identifying the main idea in a short text.
- Identifying specific details in a short text.
- Using context clues to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words.
- Obtaining general and specific information from a text.
# Stage 2 - Assessment Evidence

> [!important] All graded assignments are listed below.
## Performance Task:
**"All About Us" Class Directory**
Students will create a page for a class directory. Each student's page will include:
1. **A Personal Profile:** A short paragraph introducing themselves, including their name, age, where they are from, and a few of their interests.
2. **A Family or Friends Feature:** A short description of a family member, a close friend, or a roommate, including who they are and what they are like.
Students will present their page to a small group, and all pages will be compiled into a digital or physical class directory. This task will assess their ability to use vocabulary, identify and present key information, and communicate clearly.
## Other Evidence:
- Quizzes on vocabulary and key concepts.
- In-class activities and worksheets on identifying main ideas and specific details.
- "Exit tickets" at the end of a lesson to check for understanding.
- Informal observation of student participation in pair and group work.
