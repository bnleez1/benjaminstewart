## Layer 1 of PS

## Layer 2 of PS
Bold passages.
## Layer 3 of PS
Highlight passages.
## Layer 4 of PS
Create an executive summary and possible citation.
  
# Progressive summarization demonstration
## **Embedding Learning Styles and Neurodiversity to Educate the Workforce of Today and Tomorrow**
## Executive summary
- Learners are unique.
- To infer what a learners’ potential is regarding what they know and can do, a teacher may depend on a variety of measurements (i.e., means, experiences, and instruments).
- **Citation**: Because English language learners are unique, English language instructors should determine a learners’ potential regarding what they know and can do by relying on a variety of measurements: Kolb learning style indicator and VARK questionnaire (El-Amin, 2023).
