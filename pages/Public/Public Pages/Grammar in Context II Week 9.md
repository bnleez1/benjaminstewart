        - Deep explanation for item two above.
            
            Let's break down this TOEFL structure item and identify the error:
            
            **The newly discovered species of insect is believed to be endemic at the region.**
            
            - **a) newly:** This is an adverb modifying the adjective "discovered." It's grammatically correct.
            - **b) of:** This preposition correctly links "species" to "insect." It's grammatically correct.
            - **c) is believed:** This is a passive verb phrase and is grammatically correct within the context.
            - **d) endemic at:** This is where the error lies.
            
            **The Error:**
            
            The error is in the phrase "endemic at." The correct preposition to use with "endemic" when referring to a region is "to," not "at."
            
            **Explanation:**
            
            - "Endemic" means native or restricted to a certain place.
            - When specifying the location, we say something is "endemic _to_ a region/area/place."
            
            **Corrected Sentence:**
            
            The newly discovered species of insect is believed to be endemic **to** the region.
            
            **Therefore, the answer is d) endemic at.**
            
            Here's why "are believed" would be incorrect, and why "is believed" is correct:
            
            - **The Subject:** The subject of the sentence is "species."
            - **"Species" as a Singular Noun:** In this context, "species" is being used as a singular noun, referring to one particular species of insect. Even though the word can be plural in other contexts, here it is not.
            - **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Singular subjects require singular verbs. Therefore, the verb must be "is believed."
            - **"Are believed" would only be correct if the subject were plural.** For example, "The newly discovered _species of insects_ are believed to be endemic to the region." Here the subject is "species of insects" which is plural.
            
            **In summary:**
            
            Because the subject is "species" referring to one species, the verb must be the singular "is believed."
            
            It's tricky when words that look plural actually require singular verbs! Here's a breakdown of common categories and examples:
            
            **1. Collective Nouns (when treated as a single unit):**
            
            - These nouns represent a group of people or things. When the group acts as a single entity, use a singular verb.
                - Examples:
                    - "The team _is_ practicing."
                    - "The family _has_ decided."
                    - "The committee _meets_ regularly."
                    - "The audience _was_ silent."
                    - "The government _has_ announced."
                    - "The class _is_ going on a field trip."
            
            **2. Nouns Ending in "-ics" (referring to fields of study):**
            
            - These are often mistaken as plural, but when referring to a subject, they are singular.
                - Examples:
                    - "Mathematics _is_ my favorite subject."
                    - "Economics _is_ a complex field."
                    - "Physics _is_ very interesting."
                    - "Statistics _is_ required for this course."
                    - "Politics _is_ a very charged subject."
            
            **3. Diseases/Illnesses:**
            
            - Even though some end in "-s," they are singular.
                - Examples:
                    - "Measles _is_ highly contagious."
                    - "Mumps _is_ less common now."
                    - "Diabetes _is_ a serious condition."
            
            **4. Certain Indefinite Pronouns:**
            
            - Words like "each," "every," "everyone," "everything," "someone," "somebody," "nobody," "anyone," and "anything" are always singular.
                - Examples:
                    - "Everyone _is_ here."
                    - "Each of the students _has_ a book."
                    - "Somebody _was_ knocking."
                    - "Anything _is_ possible."
            
            **5. Titles:**
            
            - Titles of books, movies, or songs are treated as singular, even if they contain plural words.
                - Examples:
                    - "The Grapes of Wrath _is_ a classic novel."
                    - "Sweet dreams (are made of this) _is_ a popular song."
            
            **6. Measurements/Amounts (when considered a single unit):**
            
            - When a measurement is considered a single unit of measure, it is treated as singular.
                - Example:
                    - "Ten dollars _is_ too much to pay."
                    - "Five miles _is_ a long way to walk."
            
            **Important Note:**
            
            - Context is key! Some collective nouns can take a plural verb if the focus is on the individual members of the group. However, in most formal writing, the singular form is preferred.
    3. Despite of the challenges, the team remained committed to achieving their goals, admirably and efficiently. Despite, of, remained, to
        - Explanation
            
            Let's break down the grammar in the sentence "Despite of the challenges, the team remained committed to achieving their goals, admirably and efficiently," focusing on the words you've listed: "despite," "of," "remained," and "to."
            
            - **Despite:**
                - "Despite" is a preposition that means "in spite of" or "regardless of." It indicates a contrast or contradiction.
                - A common error is using "despite of." The correct form is simply "despite." "Despite" already includes the meaning of "of," so adding "of" is redundant.
                - Therefore, the sentence should be, "Despite the challenges..."
            - **of:**
                - As mentioned above, "of" is incorrect after "despite." It's a common error, but it's grammatically wrong in this context.
            - **remained:**
                - "Remained" is the past tense of the verb "remain." In this sentence, it indicates that the team continued to be committed despite the challenges. It's used correctly here.
            - **to:**
                - "To" is part of the infinitive phrase "to achieving." The verb "committed" is often followed by "to" + a gerund (-ing form of the verb).
                - "Committed to" expresses dedication or devotion to a specific action or goal.
                - In this case, "committed to achieving" is grammatically correct.
            
            **In summary:**
            
            - The error in the sentence is the use of "despite of." It should be "despite."
            - The other words, remained, and to are used correctly.
            
            Here's the corrected sentence:
            
            - "Despite the challenges, the team remained committed to achieving their goals, admirably and efficiently."
    4. The government has implemented new policies aimed at reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, nationally. has implemented, aimed, reduce, significantly
    5. The new museum exhibit features a collection of nineteenth-century paintings and sculpture from Europe. new, features, a collection, sculpture
