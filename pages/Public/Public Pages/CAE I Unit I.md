## Learning Plan Overview
### **Week 1: Personal Identity (Topics: Personal Introductions & Hobbies/Interests)**
- **W:** We will explore how to introduce ourselves and discuss our interests, focusing on using present tenses correctly to describe who we are and what we enjoy.
- **H:** Start with a "Two Truths and a Lie" game where students write three statements about themselves. This immediately gets them talking and using the target language in a fun, low-stakes way.
- **E:**
- **Experience:** Students read short biographies and listen to interviews to identify key phrases for introductions. They practice introducing themselves and a partner.
- **Explore:** In pairs, students discuss hobby-related articles, highlighting new vocabulary. They listen to conversations about hobbies to learn how to ask follow-up questions.
- **Equip:** Direct instruction and practice with Present Simple vs. Continuous and the Present Perfect. Vocabulary building activities for personal adjectives and hobbies.
- **R:** Students write a self-introduction paragraph and share it with a partner for peer feedback (Rethink/Revise) before submitting a final version for the portfolio.
- **E:** Evaluate understanding through the class profile activity, the final self-introduction paragraph, and observation of practice conversations.
- **T:** Provide sentence frames for introductions for students needing support. Challenge advanced students to use more complex adjectives or to compare their hobbies with a partner's.
- **O:** The week is organized to move from receptive skills (reading/listening) to productive skills (speaking/writing), starting with personal identity and moving to personal interests.
### **Week 2: Routines & Plans (Topics: Daily Routines & Travel/Tourism)**
- **W:** This week, we will learn how to describe recurring activities and plan for the future. We'll focus on using adverbs of frequency and future tenses to talk about our daily lives and travel aspirations.
- **H:** Show a short, engaging video clip of a person's "day in the life" (e.g., an athlete, an artist) and have students jot down all the activities they see. Discuss what makes a routine.
- **E:**
- **Experience:** Students read daily routine blogs and listen to a radio show on the topic. They work in groups to create and present an "ideal" daily routine chart.
- **Explore:** Students analyze travel guides and listen to travel podcasts to plan a dream trip itinerary.
- **Equip:** Instruction on Present Simple with adverbs of frequency and future tenses (will vs. going to). Practice creating timelines and itineraries.
- **R:** Students draft a trip itinerary and get peer feedback on its clarity and the correct use of future tenses (Rethink/Revise).
- **E:** Evaluate the daily routine chart and the final travel brochure for clarity, organization, and correct language use.
- **T:** For the travel plan, provide a template for students who need more structure. Encourage advanced students to include contingency plans ("If it rains, we will...").
- **O:** The week progresses from the certainty of daily routines to the possibility of future plans, linking the two themes through the concept of scheduling and planning.
### **Week 3: Describing the World (Topics: Food/Cooking & Technology)**
- **W:** We will focus on descriptive language, learning how to explain a process (like a recipe) and how to express a reasoned opinion (about technology). We'll use nouns, modals, and descriptive adjectives.
- **H:** Bring in (or show pictures of) an unusual food item. Have students work in small groups to describe it and guess what it is.
- **E:**
- **Experience:** Students read various recipes and watch cooking show clips to understand imperative forms and sequential language. They create a short recipe video or presentation.
- **Explore:** Students read articles on tech trends and listen to tech news to gather ideas for a debate on the pros and cons of a specific technology (e.g., social media).
- **Equip:** Direct instruction on countable/uncountable nouns (food) and modals of ability/permission (can, could, may) for discussing technology.
- **R:** Students draft a script for their recipe video and practice it. For the tech debate, students work in teams to build their arguments, anticipating and refuting counter-arguments (Rethink).
- **E:** Evaluate the recipe video/presentation and participation in the tech debate.
- **T:** Provide a vocabulary bank of cooking verbs and tech terms. For the debate, assign specific roles within teams (e.g., opening statement, rebuttal) to ensure all students participate.
- **O:** This week focuses on objects and concepts, moving from a concrete process (cooking) to a more abstract discussion (technology), building descriptive and persuasive language skills.
### **Week 4: Reviews & Recaps (Topics: Sports/Health & Entertainment)**
- **W:** We will wrap up the unit by learning how to recount past events and give reviews. We'll practice using past tenses and comparative/superlative adjectives to share our opinions and experiences. This will be direct preparation for the Midterm Project.
- **H:** Show two different movie trailers for films in the same genre. Have students vote on which they would rather see and explain why, using comparative language.
- **E:**
- **Experience:** Students read sports articles and listen to sports commentary to learn vocabulary for describing events. They write a short report on a real or imaginary game.
- **Explore:** Students read and listen to movie reviews, analyzing the structure and language used to express opinions. They write their own movie review for a class blog.
- **Equip:** Instruction and practice with Past Simple vs. Continuous and comparatives/superlatives.

- **E:** Evaluate the sports report and the final movie review blog post. The final evaluation for the unit is the Midterm Project.
- **T:** Provide templates for the movie review and sports report. Challenge advanced students to use a wider range of past tense structures and more nuanced vocabulary in their reviews and project work.
- **O:** The week is designed to synthesize skills by focusing on recounting and evaluating. It serves as a capstone for the unit's themes and provides a clear runway for students to begin their final performance tasks.
