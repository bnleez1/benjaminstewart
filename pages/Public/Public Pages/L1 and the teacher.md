The text discusses teachers' attitudes and practices regarding the use of learners' first language (L1) in English language classrooms. Teachers' attitudes are influenced by factors such as their own language learning experiences, training, institutional policies, and teaching experience. While surveys indicate that the majority of teachers believe L1 should be limited in English lessons, actual classroom practices often involve more L1 use than expected.
Teachers frequently talk about "resorting to" L1, reflecting a tension between their desired and actual practices. Some teachers report feeling guilty when using L1, which can hinder their professional development. The text emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive understanding of L1's role in language learning.
==L1 use in classrooms varies widely, with some classes using it up to 90% of the time and others not using it at all.== ==L1 use is more common in lower-level classes, larger class sizes, and when there is a shared classroom language.== Teachers often use L1 to explain grammar and vocabulary, check understanding, give instructions, and manage classroom relationships.
### Core functions
concerned with the teaching of language
- Explaining grammar and vocabulary
- Checking understanding of grammar, vocabulary, and texts (observation, testing, assignments, etc.) - assessment
### Social Functions
concerned with the management of the classroom
- Managing personal relationships (e.g., building rapport, maintaining discipline)
- Giving instructions
- Dealing with administrative matters
Arguments for excluding L1 from the classroom include the belief that learners need to think in English, that L1 use leads to first-language interference, and that L1 use takes away valuable learning opportunities. However, these arguments are challenged. Learning to think in English may not be necessary for all learners, and L1 use can help learners notice differences between languages. Additionally, some activities benefit from limited L1 use, and translation can be a valuable skill in a globalized world.
In conclusion, while research suggests that some use of L1 can support English language learning, the appropriateness of an English-only policy varies depending on the context and practical considerations. Teachers should carefully consider the role of L1 in their classrooms based on their specific circumstances.
