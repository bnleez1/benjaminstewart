## Part I

- Interview anyone close to you who has a lot of professional experience and/or education and complete the resume in your Notion page. Include also the person’s name and photo, but do not include any personal information that is not already made public: phone number, address, email, etc. Do not share the resume publicly unless you have permission from the person.
- Below the person’s resume in the Notion page, write a five-to-eight-sentence (coherent and cohesive) paragraph (i.e., 130-180 words) that answers the following questions:
    1. **Who is the person?** (Name and professional title)
    2. **What is their current role?** (Current job title and company)
    3. **What are their key skills and expertise?** (Core competencies and areas of specialization)
    4. **What are their significant achievements?** (Notable accomplishments and contributions)
    5. **What is their professional background?** (Previous roles and relevant experience)
    6. **What are their educational qualifications?** (Degrees and certifications)
    7. **What are their career goals or aspirations?** (Future objectives and ambitions)
- Below your paragraph, write two 1st conditionals and two 2nd conditionals, and make sure to include at least one example for each conditional where the main clause comes first. All conditionals should relate to the person stated in the resume.

    …
    
## Part II
- Interview the person above (in English) and ask about any interesting or surprising experiences they have had either on the job or seeking a job opportunity. The interview should last four-to-five minutes, should be recorded, and should be transcribed.
- Prepare a two-to-three minute video of you reporting on what the person said where you share your screen, showing excerpts from the conversation showing word-for-word what the person said. Your screen share _should not_ include the reported speech, but what the person actually said during the interview. Do not include any introduction or explanation of any kind, but instead should just report on what the person said.
Submit the URL to the resumé in Notion and the URL to your video as link attachments (not as a Word or PDF with the URLs) to the [Teams assignment](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/66aeee93-507d-479a-a3ef-8f494af43945/classroom?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22version%5C%22%3A%5C%221.0%5C%22%2C%5C%22config%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22classes%5C%22%3A%5B%7B%5C%22id%5C%22%3A%5C%220a97527a-229c-4155-8f43-be4831abf2bf%5C%22%2C%5C%22assignmentIds%5C%22%3A%5B%5C%22f69b8ff8-a42a-4075-8111-47f0ceed5456%5C%22%5D%7D%5D%7D%2C%5C%22action%5C%22%3A%5C%22navigate%5C%22%2C%5C%22view%5C%22%3A%5C%22assignment-viewer%5C%22%2C%5C%22appId%5C%22%3A%5C%221fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264%5C%22%2C%5C%22deeplinkType%5C%22%3A4%7D%22%2C%22channelId%22%3Anull%7D).
