# Definition, Importance, Origins, and Its Relationship with Bilingualism
## Introduction
Language is rarely uniform in practice. Communities often use different varieties of a language—or entirely different languages—depending on the situation, the participants, and the function of communication. This phenomenon, known as **diglossia**, has been central to sociolinguistic inquiry for decades. While closely related to bilingualism, diglossia is a distinct concept that describes the patterned, societal use of language varieties rather than simply individual linguistic ability. This article explores what diglossia is, why it is important, how it comes about, and its complex relationship with bilingualism.

## What Is Diglossia?
The term **diglossia** was first introduced in its modern sense by Charles Ferguson (1959), who described it as the stable coexistence of two varieties of the same language within a single speech community. According to Ferguson’s classic model, three conditions define diglossia:
1. **Two varieties of the same language** exist, labeled the **High (H)** variety and the **Low (L)** variety.
2. Each variety is used for **distinct functions**: H is reserved for formal, institutional, and written contexts, while L is used for everyday, informal conversation.
3. **The H variety is not used in ordinary conversation**, even by highly educated speakers.
Examples of classic diglossia include:
- **Arabic-speaking countries**, where Modern Standard Arabic (H) is used for religious, educational, and official functions, while local dialects (L) are used in daily life.
- **Switzerland**, where Standard German (H) and Swiss German dialects (L) coexist.
- **Greece** until the late 20th century, where Katharévousa (H) existed alongside Dhimotiki (L).
In these situations, H carries overt prestige, being codified in grammar books and dictionaries, while L often enjoys covert prestige as the authentic medium of everyday identity and solidarity.

## Why Is Diglossia Important?
Diglossia is crucial for several reasons:
### 1. **Sociolinguistic Stability**
Diglossia explains how multiple varieties can coexist in a community without one immediately replacing the other. For centuries, Classical Arabic and local dialects have functioned in parallel, each maintaining distinct domains of use. This division of labor stabilizes linguistic diversity.
### 2. **Cultural and Identity Functions**
H varieties often symbolize education, authority, and religion, while L varieties serve as the language of intimacy, humor, and solidarity. For example, Haitian Creole (L) expresses emotions and everyday life, while French (H) is tied to prestige and officialdom.
### 3. **Language Policy and Education**
Understanding diglossia helps explain educational challenges. In many countries, children grow up speaking the L variety but are expected to read and write in the H variety. This creates barriers to literacy and achievement unless explicit attention is given to bridging the gap.
### 4. **Language Attitudes and Power Relations**
Diglossia highlights the interplay between language and power. H varieties are often imposed by institutions, reinforcing social hierarchies. For instance, in France, standard French gradually displaced rural dialects, stigmatizing them as “peasant speech”.

## How Does Diglossia Come About?
The origins of diglossia can usually be traced to **historical, political, and social factors**:
### 1. **Colonization and Conquest**
Many diglossic situations arise from colonization. In Haiti, French became the H variety through colonial imposition, while Haitian Creole developed among the enslaved population as the L variety. Similarly, in Norman England after 1066, French (H) was the language of the court and administration, while English (L) was spoken by the common people.
### 2. **Religious and Literary Traditions**
Some diglossic arrangements emerge from the preservation of sacred or classical texts. In Arabic-speaking communities, Classical Arabic retains its role because it is the language of the Qur’an, even though colloquial dialects dominate daily communication.
### 3. **Standardization and Education**
The codification of certain varieties in grammars, dictionaries, and school curricula creates H varieties. For instance, Standard German is taught in schools and used in writing, while Swiss German dialects persist in oral communication.
### 4. **Urbanization and Modernization**
As societies industrialize and centralize, certain varieties are promoted for administration and education, while others remain tied to family and local identity. This functional differentiation can crystallize into diglossia.

## Diglossia and Its Relationship with Bilingualism
Although closely related, **diglossia and bilingualism are not the same**.
### 1. **Individual vs. Societal Phenomena**
- **Bilingualism** refers to an individual’s ability to use two languages.
- **Diglossia** describes a **community-wide arrangement**, where two varieties (languages or dialects) have complementary functions.
As Hudson (2002) noted, “individuals are bilingual, but communities are diglossic.”
### 2. **Fishman’s Model**
Joshua Fishman (1967; 2003) expanded the concept, showing that diglossia can exist **with or without bilingualism**. He outlined four possible relationships (see Table 2.4):
1. **Both diglossia and bilingualism** – Individuals are bilingual, and the community assigns different functions to languages. Example: Vanuatu, where people speak local languages plus Bislama.
2. **Bilingualism without diglossia** – Individuals are bilingual, but the community does not divide functions systematically. Example: many immigrants in the U.S.
3. **Diglossia without bilingualism** – A community requires two varieties, but most individuals are monolingual. Example: Haiti, where most speak only Haitian Creole, but French dominates official functions.
4. **Neither diglossia nor bilingualism** – Monolingual communities with little contact with other languages, such as Iceland before the 20th century.
### 3. **Overlap and Extensions**
Some scholars extend diglossia to include situations with two distinct languages, not just varieties of the same language. For example, Paraguay has long been described as diglossic, with Spanish (H) and Guaraní (L) serving different domains. This broader sense highlights the **division of labor** more than linguistic relatedness.
### 4. **Diglossia vs. Code-Switching**
In a diglossic situation, H and L are reserved for **clearly separate domains** (e.g., newspapers vs. gossiping). Code-switching, by contrast, occurs when speakers fluidly alternate between varieties within the same interaction for rhetorical or social reasons. While related, diglossia is more stable and institutionalized.

## Changes in Diglossic Situations
Though often stable, diglossia can change:
- **Language shift**: Over time, an L variety may encroach upon H functions. English eventually displaced French in England after the 14th century.
- **Elimination of diglossia**: In Greece, the H variety Katharévousa was legally abolished in favor of Modern Greek in 1976.
- **Expansion into polyglossia**: In some multilingual contexts, more than two varieties coexist, creating what scholars call **polyglossia**. For example, in Singapore, Mandarin and Standard English function as H varieties alongside Cantonese, Hokkien, and informal Singapore English as L varieties.

## Conclusion
Diglossia is a key concept in sociolinguistics because it reveals how societies organize and distribute language use across domains. It shows that languages are not just neutral tools but are bound up with power, identity, education, and culture. While bilingualism describes an individual’s capacity, diglossia describes a **social system of linguistic division of labor**. The two are deeply interconnected: bilingualism makes diglossia possible in some cases, but diglossia can also persist in communities with limited bilingualism.
In a globalized world where languages constantly interact, understanding diglossia remains essential. It helps explain why certain varieties gain prestige, why others are stigmatized, and how societies manage linguistic diversity over time.
