**Instructions**: This week's speaking practice will be with your partner listed below. Share a positive and/or negative experience that you have had using technology and explain why. Share your story with your speaking partner, making sure you stay on topic and you keep the conversation going. A good conversation will include 1) webcams turned on, 2) fluid conversation (little awkward gaps in the conversation), 3) expressing an experience and opinion on the topic. We'll go in order, Team #1 first, Team #2 second, etc.
**Speaking partners will be assigned just before we begin our speaking practice.**
