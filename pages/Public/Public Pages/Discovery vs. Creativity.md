One thing we need to clear up first, is that creativity and discovery are not the same thing. Discovery is unearthing something new: that which hasn't been known before. The discoverer does not know anything of the thing discovered until the discovery occurs. This helps us with what creativity is not: although of course creative people do discover things, creativity can be a frame of mind, whereas discovery cannot (Jones, 2023, p. 2).
Discovery can be a preliminary part of a creative process, but only the latter can be a frame of mind.
