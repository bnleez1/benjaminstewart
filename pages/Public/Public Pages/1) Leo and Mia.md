In a small town, there lived a boy named Leo. Leo was very shy. He did not have many friends. He loved to build things with wood. His father was a carpenter. Leo learned from him. In his room, Leo had many wooden toys. He made a small car, a little house, and a tiny chair. These toys were his only friends. He talked to them.
One day, a new family moved into the house next door. The family had a girl named Mia. Mia was very outgoing and friendly. She saw Leo in his garden.
“Hi!” said Mia. “I’m Mia. What is your name?”
Leo was shy. He looked at the ground. “I’m Leo,” he said in a quiet voice.
“What are you doing?” asked Mia.
“Nothing,” said Leo. He was holding a small wooden dog he made. He hid it behind his back.
Mia was curious. “What is behind your back?” she asked.
Leo did not want to show her. He was afraid she would laugh at his toys. But Mia was very kind. She waited.
Slowly, Leo showed her the wooden dog. “I made it,” he said.
Mia’s eyes opened wide. “Wow! That is amazing. You are very creative. Can you make a cat?”
Leo was surprised. She liked his toy. He was not expecting that. “Yes,” he said. “I can make a cat.”
The next day, Leo made a small wooden cat. He painted it with black stripes. He went to Mia’s house. He was nervous. He knocked on the door.
Mia opened the door. “Leo! Hi!”
Leo gave her the wooden cat. “This is for you,” he said.
Mia was so happy. “Thank you! It is beautiful. You are a very good artist. Do you want to come in and play?”
Leo was hesitant. He never played with other children. But Mia’s smile was warm. “Okay,” he said.
Leo went into Mia’s room. She did not have wooden toys. She had dolls and books and puzzles. They played together all afternoon. They talked about their favorite colors and their favorite foods. Leo learned that Mia was from a big city. Mia learned that Leo wanted to be a carpenter like his father. They shared their personal information. They shared their stories.
From that day on, Leo and Mia were best friends. Leo was still a quiet boy, but he was not shy with Mia. He learned that sharing his hobby did not make people laugh. It helped him make a new friend. He still made wooden toys, but now he had a real friend to share them with. He learned that being open and sharing a little piece of who you are is the first step to building a great friendship.
