### **Purpose and Desired Results**
Welcome to this module on the language of jobs and careers. Professional conversations are fundamentally about the future—the future of a project, the future of a company, and, most importantly, our own future **career path**. Navigating these discussions requires a specific linguistic toolkit that allows us to distinguish between what is likely and what is imagined, between a concrete plan and a hypothetical dream.
This chapter focuses on mastering the First and Second Conditionals as strategic tools for professional communication. By the end of this six-day module, you will understand that discussing job prospects and career plans involves expressing possibilities and hypothetical situations clearly to communicate aspirations and potential outcomes in professional contexts1. You will learn to wield conditionals not just as grammatical rules, but as powerful instruments for planning, negotiating, advising, and articulating your professional ambitions with clarity and confidence.
### **Reading: The Strategy of "If" in the Workplace**
In the professional world, the word "if" is one of the most powerful in our vocabulary. It opens doors to planning, negotiation, problem-solving, and aspiration. The way we build the sentences that follow "if" determines whether we are talking about a real-world plan or exploring a hypothetical scenario. This distinction, represented by the First and Second Conditionals, is critical for clear communication in any professional context, from a **job interview** to a performance review.
The First Conditional (If + Present Simple, ... will + infinitive) is the language of real possibility. It is the tool we use to talk about the likely results of our actions. It is concrete, grounded, and forward-looking. In a professional setting, we use it to make plans, state consequences, and negotiate terms. As language teaching experts like Parrott (2010) explain, the First Conditional deals with the world of real-world cause and effect, making it essential for practical, goal-oriented discussions. A manager uses it to set expectations, and an employee uses it to outline their intended actions.

**Dialogue 1: A manager discussing a new project with an employee.**
**Manager:** Thanks for submitting your proposal. I think it has a lot of potential. If we **secure** the funding, we **will launch** the project in the third quarter.
**Employee:** That's great news. I’m confident about my role. If I **manage** the team effectively, I **will deliver** the first phase on schedule.
**Manager:** Excellent. Remember, if you **need** any additional resources, the **human resources** department **will help** you with the paperwork. Let’s make this a success.

This conversation is built on the First Conditional. Every "if" clause presents a realistic possibility, and the main clause states the expected outcome. The language is direct and action-oriented. It’s the language of planning and commitment.
The Second Conditional (If + Past Simple, ... would + infinitive), by contrast, is the language of imagination and hypothesis. It allows us to step away from the real world to explore unreal, unlikely, or imaginary situations. Its power lies in its ability to create a safe space for discussion. We use it to give advice, explore theoretical challenges, and discuss dreams and aspirations without committing to them. A common and crucial use is in giving advice with "If I **were** you...", a structure that uses the subjunctive mood to underscore the hypothetical nature of the statement (Ur, 1996).

**Dialogue 2: A job interview for a marketing position.**
**Interviewer:** Thank you for coming in. Your **résumé** is very impressive. I have a hypothetical question for you. If we **hired** you for this position, what **would** be the first thing you **would change**?
**Candidate:** That’s an interesting question. I think if I **had** the opportunity, I **would conduct** a full audit of the current social media strategy to identify areas for growth.
**Interviewer:** And what **would you do** if a major campaign you designed **were** to fail?
**Candidate:** Of course, no one wants that. But if that **happened**, I **would immediately analyze** the data to understand what went wrong and present a revised plan to the team. If I **were** the team lead, I **would take** full responsibility.

Here, the Second Conditional is used to explore the candidate's problem-solving skills and professional judgment. The interviewer is not asking what the candidate
_will_
do, but what they
_would_
do in an imagined reality. The candidate's ability to respond fluently using the same structure demonstrates their capacity for abstract thinking and strategic planning.
Confusing these two conditional forms can lead to significant miscommunication. If a candidate says, "If you **will give** me the job, I **will increase** sales by 50%," it sounds like an unrealistic and slightly arrogant promise. Saying, "If you **gave** me the job, I **would focus** on increasing sales by 50%" sounds like a confident and strategic aspiration. The first is a risky promise; the second is a professional goal.
As language teachers, our task is to guide learners to see this functional difference. They must understand that the choice between the First and Second Conditional is a strategic one, based entirely on the speaker’s purpose. Is the goal to make a concrete plan or to explore a hypothetical possibility? Answering that question is the key to mastering the language of professional ambition.

### **Weekly Activities (6 x 1-hour classes)**
### **Class 1: Introduction and Professional Vocabulary**
- **Objective:** To introduce the context of career planning and activate relevant job-related vocabulary.
- **Activity 1 (20 mins) - "The Career Ladder":** In pairs, learners discuss a dream job. They brainstorm the steps needed to get there, from education to gaining experience. This will naturally elicit the need for language about future plans and aspirations.
- **Activity 2 (30 mins) - Professional Lexis Sort:** Give groups of learners cards with **job-related terms** 2 (e.g.,
    
    _résumé, cover letter, qualifications, skills, promotion, salary, benefits, colleague, internship_). They must sort them into logical categories (e.g., "Applying for a Job," "Working at a Job," "Job Perks").
    
### **Class 2: The First Conditional - Plans and Promises**
- **Objective:** To practice the form and function of the First Conditional for making realistic plans.
- **Activity (45 mins) - The Performance Review:** Set up a role-play between a manager and an employee. The manager sets goals for the next quarter. They must create a concrete action plan using First Conditional statements. (e.g., "If you **complete** the training course, you **will be eligible** for a **promotion**." "If I **meet** all my targets, **will** I get a bonus?").
### **Class 3: The Second Conditional - Advice and Hypotheticals**
- **Objective:** To practice the form and function of the Second Conditional for giving advice and exploring hypothetical scenarios.
- **Activity 1 (25 mins) - "If I Were You...":** Present groups with common workplace dilemmas (e.g., "My **colleague** takes credit for my work," "I have too much work and not enough time"). Learners must give each other advice using the structure "If I **were** you, I **would**...".
- **Activity 2 (20 mins) - "The Tough Interview":** In pairs, learners role-play a **job interview** where the interviewer asks only Second Conditional hypothetical questions ("What **would you do** if you **disagreed** with your manager's decision?").
### **Class 4: Distinguishing Form and Function**
- **Objective:** To strengthen learners' ability to choose the correct conditional based on the communicative context.
- **Activity (45 mins) - "Real or Imagined?":** Give learners a worksheet with professional scenarios. For each one, they must write a relevant sentence, deciding if it requires the First Conditional (a real possibility) or the Second Conditional (a hypothetical situation). They then compare and justify their answers with a partner. Example scenarios: "You are discussing the potential outcome of a new marketing campaign." (1st) vs. "You are brainstorming 'dream features' for a product that you don't have the budget to build." (2nd).
### **Class 5: A Pedagogical Focus**
- **Objective:** To encourage learners to think about how they would teach conditionals effectively.
- **Activity 1 (25 mins) - Error Analysis:** Provide the teacher learners with a set of sentences containing typical student errors in the First and Second Conditionals. They must correct the sentences and prepare a simple, clear explanation of the rule for a B1-level student, paying special attention to the use of _will_ in if-clauses and the subjunctive _were_.
- **Activity 2 (20 mins) - Designing a Concept Question:** In pairs, learners write Concept Checking Questions (CCQs) for two sentences: 1. "If I get the promotion, I will buy a new car." 2. "If I got the promotion, I would buy a new car." The CCQs should clearly highlight the difference in likelihood.
### **Class 6: Culminating Task - The Career Consultation Role-Play**
- **Objective:** To synthesize all skills in a communicative task that directly assesses the enduring understanding.
- **Activity (50 mins) - "Navigating the Next Step":** In groups of three, learners role-play a career consultation.
- **Role 1: The Employee:** Discusses their career goals, using the **First Conditional** for their realistic, short-term plans and the **Second Conditional** for their long-term aspirations or "dream job" scenarios.
- **Role 2: The Mentor/HR Manager:** Listens and gives advice using the **Second Conditional** ("If I **were** in your position, I **would consider** getting another **qualification**.").
- **Role 3: The Observer:** Takes notes on the appropriate and inappropriate uses of the conditional forms and provides feedback to the other two at the end of the role-play.
