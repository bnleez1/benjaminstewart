### Expository essay grades
- This past weekend, you should have received a PDF of your completed final draft of your expository essay with the following: 1) my comments, 2) originality score, and 3) AI feedback. Based on these three types of feedback, a final grade was assigned to the Microsoft Teams assignment.
- AI feedback was provided only to those with an originality score between 90%-100%.
- Review [[Plagiarism- The copycat crime in academia and beyond]] & [[UAA language departmental plagiarism policy 2024]].
    - Citations with no references and references with no citations are types of plagiarism.
    - Citations not within the sentence they refer to is an example of plagiarism.
    - See the UAA language department plagiarism policy for more examples.
- For those with an originality score less than 90%, schedule time with me outside of class to discuss your work and provide strategies on how to increase your score. Before we meet, share with me a folder in your UAA edu OneDrive with all of the references you used in your essay as a PDF.
- During exams week, December 2-6, 2024, everyone will have an opportunity to redo their expository essay. ==[Only changes made to this folder will be considered](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAEI/EmvD_adrtNpHgzAOoqTF5JQBZSkCZeg3OvXPJKWbr4LNsg?e=v6s5Qv)==. It’s important to take into consideration your expository essay feedback when completing the second essay at the end of the semester (which cannot be redone). Schedule time with me outside of class if you want to discuss changes to your essay, and if anyone wants me to recheck their originality scores again, review and then send me a message via Microsoft Teams.
    - I ask that anyone who wants to redo their expository essay that you add a folder to [Expository essay redos](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAEI/EmvD_adrtNpHgzAOoqTF5JQBZSkCZeg3OvXPJKWbr4LNsg?e=aPQmba), and rename the folder using your full name, first name first. Move your Word document to your respective folders and any references that are not .gov, .org. or .edu websites as PDFs. Please do this by the end of today.

- Today’s tasks
    - Personal style: What aspects of your personal style do you think are most reflected in your clothing choices?
        
        Wearing apparel is a powerful form of self-expression. Here are a few ways it reflects personal style:
        
        1. **Choice of Colors**: The colors you choose can say a lot about your personality. For instance, bright colors might indicate a bold and outgoing personality, while neutral tones might suggest a more reserved and classic style.
        2. **Types of Clothing**: Whether you prefer casual wear, formal attire, or something in between, your clothing choices can reflect your lifestyle and preferences. For example, someone who loves outdoor activities might often be seen in sporty or functional clothing.
        3. **Accessories**: Items like jewelry, watches, hats, and scarves can add a unique touch to your outfit and showcase your individual taste.
        4. **Fit and Silhouette**: The way your clothes fit can also be a reflection of your style. Some people prefer tailored, fitted clothing, while others might opt for a more relaxed, oversized look.
        5. **Cultural Influences**: Your cultural background can influence your style, incorporating traditional elements into modern fashion.
        6. **Trends vs. Timeless Pieces**: Some people love to follow the latest fashion trends, while others prefer timeless, classic pieces that never go out of style.

> [!important] For those who need to modify their expository essay due to plagiarism, I will dedicate next Tuesday’s class, October 29, 2024, to attend those who want assistance. Changes done in class will receive a change in grade immediately instead of having to wait until the end of the semester. As time permits, we can also discuss originality scores and how to increase them. In order to discuss originality scores, it would need beforehand access to your references in the form of a PDF, which you may submit to your Teams folder: [Final exam week](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CAEI/EvU0CMe43ylOkSxR7e4t9mQBfUVYmOELRpYVlko9L-XqPQ?e=9e4k6i).
