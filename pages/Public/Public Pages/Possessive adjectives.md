Possessive adjectives are words used to show ownership or possession. They indicate to whom or what something belongs. In English, possessive adjectives are used before nouns and change form based on the subject (the possessor). Possessive adjectives are also a type of determiner - see [[Determiners]].
Here are the possessive adjectives in English:
1. **My** - used with the first person singular (I)
2. **Your** - used with the second person singular and plural (you)
3. **His** - used with the third person singular masculine (he)
4. **Her** - used with the third person singular feminine (she)
5. **Its** - used with the third person singular neuter (it)
6. **Our** - used with the first person plural (we)
7. **Your** - used with the second person plural (you)
8. **Their** - used with the third person plural (they)
