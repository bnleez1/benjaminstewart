- This week we’ll work here: [Past experiences.docx](https://eduuaa.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/WritingI/EVFXr7lA6DRKmHpH-XPOoT4BZnOW5GKLPLhiOORfZZZ75g?e=nvkHGz).
- Today, we’ll brainstorm on a past experience and begin reading to find a specific fact, statistic, example, or detail related to your main idea or topic sentence.
- Read the following story for Tuesday. What’s the moral of the story?
    
    Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, there lived a young boy named Thomas. Thomas had always been curious about the world around him. He spent his days exploring the woods, climbing trees, and observing the animals that lived there. Curiosity is a natural and essential trait in children, driving them to explore and learn about their environment (Boudreau, 2020).
    
    One day, while wandering deeper into the forest than he had ever gone before, Thomas stumbled upon an old, abandoned cabin. The door creaked as he pushed it open, revealing a room filled with dust and cobwebs. In the corner of the room, he found a dusty old book. The cover was worn, and the pages were yellowed with age. Thomas had never seen such a book before, and his curiosity got the better of him. He decided to take it home.
    
    That evening, Thomas sat by the fireplace, eagerly flipping through the pages of the book. He discovered that it was filled with stories and legends about the village and the surrounding forest. One story, in particular, caught his attention. It was about a hidden treasure buried somewhere in the forest. The story claimed that the treasure had been hidden by a wise old man who wanted to teach the villagers a lesson about greed and generosity.
    
    Thomas couldn’t stop thinking about the treasure. He decided that he would find it and use it to help his family and the villagers. The next morning, he set out on his quest. He had packed a small bag with some food and water and had brought along a map he had drawn based on the clues in the book.
    
    As Thomas ventured deeper into the forest, he noticed that the trees seemed to grow taller and the air felt cooler. He had been walking for hours when he came across a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a massive oak tree. According to the book, the treasure was buried at the base of this tree.
    
    Thomas began to dig. He dug for what felt like hours, his hands blistered and his muscles aching. Just as he was about to give up, his shovel hit something hard. He had found a small wooden chest. With trembling hands, he opened it, revealing a pile of gold coins and precious jewels.
    
    Overwhelmed with excitement, Thomas hurried back to the village to share his discovery. The villagers were amazed and gathered around to see the treasure. Thomas explained that he wanted to use the treasure to help everyone in the village. They could repair their homes, buy food, and improve their lives.
    
    However, not everyone in the village shared Thomas’s selfless intentions. Some villagers began to argue over how the treasure should be divided. Greed and jealousy started to spread, and soon the village was in chaos. Thomas watched in dismay as the villagers, who had once been kind and generous, turned against each other. Greed can have profound negative effects on communities, leading to conflict and social instability (Believe In Mind, 2024).
    
    Realizing that the treasure had caused more harm than good, Thomas decided to take action. He gathered the villagers and reminded them of the story in the book. The wise old man had hidden the treasure to teach them a lesson about greed and generosity. Thomas urged the villagers to come together and use the treasure for the greater good, rather than fighting over it.
    
    Slowly, the villagers began to see the wisdom in Thomas’s words. They agreed to work together and use the treasure to benefit everyone. They repaired their homes, built a school, and created a community garden. The village flourished, and the villagers learned the importance of generosity and cooperation. Cooperation and selflessness can lead to stronger, more resilient communities (Psychologily, 2023).
    
    Years later, Thomas had grown into a wise and respected leader. He often reflected on the lesson he had learned from the treasure. He realized that true wealth was not measured in gold or jewels, but in the kindness and generosity of the people around him.
    
    And so, the village thrived, and the story of Thomas and the hidden treasure was passed down through generations, reminding everyone of the importance of selflessness and community.
