        - Reading 1 - The Whispering Reef
            
            To the human ear, a coral reef can seem deceptively quiet. Yet a healthy reef is anything but silent: it crackles and pops with the snaps of shrimp and the grunts of small fishes. Marine biologists now refer to this biological noise as a kind of _soundscape_. For organisms drifting in the open ocean—especially the larval stages of reef fishes—these sounds can function like a beacon, guiding the young back to suitable habitat after weeks of pelagic life.
            
            Experiments have shown that larvae placed in chambers with recordings of thriving reefs swim toward the speakers, while those exposed to recordings from degraded reefs show weaker responses. The implication is straightforward: quieter reefs may fail to recruit the very animals that help them recover. Restoration teams have begun placing underwater speakers at some sites to “seed” soundscapes during key settlement periods. The approach is hardly a cure‑all, but early trials suggest it can accelerate repopulation when paired with other efforts such as controlling fishing pressure and restoring coral cover.
            
            Sound is not the only cue larvae use. Chemical traces shed by algae and corals, as well as coastal currents and the dim patterns of moonlight near the surface, can also play a role. Nevertheless, the acoustic signature of a reef has a particular advantage: unlike chemical cues that diffuse quickly, sound can travel across hundreds of meters with relatively little loss of information. That makes a vibrant reef audible well before it is visible.
            
            **R1Q1 (Factual) — What attracts larvae?**
            
            Correct Answer: _The snapping of shrimp and the noises of small fishes._
            
            **R1Q2 (Vocabulary) — 'soundscape'**
            
            Correct Answer: _the overall pattern of sounds in an environment._
            
            **R1Q3 (Inference) — Quieter reefs**
            
            Correct Answer: _They may recruit fewer young fish, slowing recovery._
            
            **R1Q4 (Negative Factual) — Not mentioned benefit**
            
            Correct Answer: _Speakers eliminate the need to regulate fishing._
            
            **R1Q5 (Sentence Simplification) — Essential meaning**
            
            Correct Answer: _Using speakers alone will not fix a reef, but in combination with other measures they can speed the return of reef organisms._
            
            **R1Q6 (Insert Text) — Best position**
            
            Correct Answer: _[C]_
            
            **R1Q7 (Vocabulary) — 'diffuse'**
            
            Correct Answer: _spread out._
            
            **R1Q8 (Factual) — Why sound effective**
            
            Correct Answer: _Sound travels farther with less loss of information._
            
            **R1Q9 (Inference) — Degraded reefs**
            
            Correct Answer: _Recordings from degraded reefs elicit weaker swimming responses because their soundscapes lack the cues larvae seek._
            
            **R1Q10 (Classification) — Which category?**
            
            Correct Answer: _Snapping-shrimp crackle recorded from a thriving reef._
            
        - Reading 2 - Paper Money in Song-Dynasty China
            
            During China’s Song dynasty (960–1279), merchants in several cities began using paper instruments in place of bulky bronze coins. These privately issued notes, called _jiaozi_, were originally receipts that certified a deposit of coin at a money‑changer’s shop. Because the notes could be transferred to settle debts, they soon circulated beyond the original depositors and became a convenient medium of exchange for long‑distance trade.
            
            As the scale of commerce grew, the government moved to regulate the practice. Authorities required that issuers maintain adequate reserves, standardized note design, and imposed expiration dates to limit overissue. Eventually, the state monopolized note production and created official paper currency backed by stores of coin and goods. Although counterfeiting and regional shortages of metal money occasionally undermined confidence, the system generally facilitated taxation and reduced the costs of moving wealth across great distances.
            
            The Song experience shows that money is as much about trust as about metal. A note had value because reputable merchants—and later the government—stood behind its redemption. The familiar logic of convertibility that underpinned early Chinese paper instruments would reappear centuries later, when banks in Europe issued promises to pay in specie on demand.
            
            **R2Q1 (Vocabulary) — 'receipts'**
            
            Correct Answer: _written acknowledgments of deposits._
            
            **R2Q2 (Factual) — Why notes spread**
            
            Correct Answer: _They could be transferred to settle debts, making them convenient for trade._
            
            **R2Q3 (Inference) — Government regulation**
            
            Correct Answer: _Officials wanted to stabilize the system and prevent overissue that might erode trust._
            
            **R2Q4 (Negative Factual) — NOT mentioned motivation**
            
            Correct Answer: _Banning the use of paper notes for tax payments._
            
            **R2Q5 (Vocabulary) — 'convertibility'**
            
            Correct Answer: _the ability to be exchanged for coin or specie._
            
            **R2Q6 (Sentence Simplification) — Essential meaning**
            
            Correct Answer: _Despite some problems, paper currency on the whole made taxing and transferring wealth easier and cheaper._
            
            **R2Q7 (Insert Text) — Best position**
            
            Correct Answer: _[D]_
            
            **R2Q8 (Factual) — Why valuable**

            Correct Answer: _promised to pay the holder a specific amount of coin on demand._
            
            **R2Q10 (Classification) — Which category?**
            
            Correct Answer: _State actions._
            
        - Reading 3 - The Printing Press and Pamphlet Culture
            
            When movable‑type printing appeared in mid‑fifteenth‑century Europe, its most visible products were not massive books but small, quickly produced pamphlets. Cheap sheets, folded once or twice, could be printed overnight and carried by peddlers along trade routes that already knit towns together. Because pamphlets were brief and topical, they became a vehicle for everything from sensational news to practical advice and religious argument.
            
            Authorities worried about the social consequences of this new speed of communication. Some cities licensed presses and required prior approval for controversial works; others allowed publication first and punished printers later. In either case, censorship proved uneven. Copies slipped across borders, and reprints sprang up wherever sympathetic buyers could be found. Meanwhile, literacy was rising—slowly and unevenly—creating wider audiences without eliminating the need for public readings in marketplaces and churches.
            
            Pamphlet culture did not replace learned scholarship, but it changed the rhythm of public debate. Brief formats encouraged sharp claims and memorable slogans. The same features that helped ideas spread—low cost, portability, and speed—also made it difficult to ensure accuracy. Yet even critics acknowledged that the press created a new sense of simultaneity: people in distant towns could argue about the same text within days.
            
            **R3Q1 (Factual) — Why pamphlets spread**
            
            Correct Answer: _They were inexpensive and could be carried along existing trade routes._
            
            **R3Q2 (Vocabulary) — 'topical'**
            
            Correct Answer: _concerned with current events._
            
            **R3Q3 (Negative Factual) — NOT stated about censorship**
            
            Correct Answer: _Censorship prevented pamphlets from crossing political borders._
            
            **R3Q4 (Inference) — Public readings**
            
            Correct Answer: _They remained useful because literacy was increasing unevenly._
            
            **R3Q5 (Sentence Simplification) — Essential meaning**
            
            Correct Answer: _The qualities that allowed pamphlets to circulate widely also made them prone to errors._
            
            **R3Q6 (Insert Text) — Best position**
            
            Correct Answer: _[A]_
            
            **R3Q7 (Vocabulary) — 'simultaneity'**
            
            Correct Answer: _a condition of happening at the same time._
            
            **R3Q8 (Factual) — Rhythm of debate**
            
            Correct Answer: _favoring brief, memorable claims that circulated quickly._
            
            **R3Q9 (Inference) — Critics acknowledged**
            
            Correct Answer: _To show that the widespread, rapid circulation of texts was evident to supporters and opponents alike._
            
            **R3Q10 (Classification) — Which category?**
            
            Correct Answer: _Constraints on diffusion._
