**Abstract**
This study examined the relationship between social media use and self-esteem in adolescents. A sample of 200 high school students completed a survey assessing their social media habits and self-esteem levels. Results indicated a significant negative correlation between time spent on social media and self-esteem. Additionally, the type of social media engagement (e.g., passive vs. active) moderated this relationship. These findings suggest that excessive social media use may be detrimental to adolescents' self-esteem, particularly when engagement is passive. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this association and to develop interventions to promote healthy social media use.
