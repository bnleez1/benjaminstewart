# **Unit 2: A Day in the Life**
# Stage 1 - Desired Results
## Established Goals
This four-week unit explores the language and skills needed to navigate everyday life. Students will learn to find and understand information related to university life, making appointments, getting around the city, and food. They will develop reading skills such as scanning, inferring meaning from context, identifying key ideas, and summarizing to effectively manage daily tasks and social engagements.
### Transfer
Students will be able to independently use their learning to 1) navigate new environments like a university campus or a city by understanding signs, maps, and directories; 2) schedule and manage personal appointments and social commitments; 3) make informed choices in daily situations, such as ordering from a menu or deciding on an activity.
### Meaning
### Understandings:
Students will understand that:
- Successfully managing daily life in a new language requires specific strategies for finding and understanding information quickly.
- How people spend their time and what they eat can reflect cultural values and priorities.
- Effective communication involves not just what you say, but understanding the context of where you are and what is happening around you.
### Essential Questions:
- How do we balance our responsibilities and our social lives?
- How does our environment (our university, our city) shape our daily experiences?
- What can we learn about a culture from its food and daily routines?
- What strategies can I use when I don't understand every word?
### Acquisition
### _Learners will know…_
Students will know:
- Vocabulary related to university life (e.g., library, classroom, student ID, schedule, assignment).
- Language for making, changing, and keeping appointments and commitments (e.g., Are you free on...?, I'd like to make an appointment., Let's meet at...).
- Vocabulary for places in the city (e.g., bank, supermarket, bus stop, museum).
- Vocabulary for food, ordering in a restaurant, and describing meals.
### _Students will be skilled at…_
Students will be skilled at:
- Obtaining general and specific information from texts.
- Identifying main ideas.
- Inferring the meaning of unknown words through context.
- Scanning a text for specific details (e.g., a time, a place, a name).
- Summarizing a text.
# Stage 2 - Assessment Evidence

> [!important] All graded assignments are listed below.
## Performance Task:
**"My Ideal Day Out" Itinerary**
Students will create a detailed, one-day itinerary for a visitor coming to their city. The itinerary must include:
1. **A Morning University Activity:** Finding information about a workshop, club meeting, or event on a mock university website and including the key details (time, location, description).
2. **An Afternoon Appointment:** Scheduling a fictional appointment (e.g., with a professor, a doctor, or for a haircut) and writing a short confirmation dialogue or email.
3. **An Evening in the City:** Planning an evening out that involves navigating to a location in the city and choosing a place to eat. Students will use a map to give simple directions and a menu to select a meal.
Students will present their itinerary to a small group, explaining their choices and summarizing the plan for the day. This task assesses their ability to obtain and synthesize information, use vocabulary from all four topics, and summarize a plan.
## Other Evidence:
- Quizzes on vocabulary for each topic.
- In-class activities where students scan texts (e.g., a university events page, a bus schedule, a restaurant menu) to find specific information under a time limit.
- Worksheets requiring students to identify the main idea and supporting details in short paragraphs about daily life.
- "Context Clues" challenges where students define highlighted words in a text and explain how they figured out the meaning.
- A short written summary of a blog post or article about food or city life.
# Stage 3 - Learning Plan
## Learning Plan (WHERETO)
### **Week 1: University Life**
- **W (Where/Why):** Introduce the unit and the final "Ideal Day Out" project. Explain that mastering university life is the first step to feeling comfortable in their new environment.
- **H (Hook):** Give students a mock "student ID" and a campus map. In pairs, they must find key locations on the map.
- **E (Equip/Experience):** Introduce vocabulary for places, people, and activities on campus. Students will read university brochures and website pages to practice obtaining general and specific information and identifying main ideas. They will practice inferring the meaning of academic-related words from context.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** Students will create their own "Welcome to the University" tip sheet and get feedback from a partner.
- **E (Evaluate):** An exit ticket asking students to identify the main idea and one specific detail from a short text about a university club.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide texts at different reading levels. For the tip sheet, offer sentence frames for support.
- **O (Organize):** The week is organized to help students feel confident navigating the immediate world of their university.
### **Week 2: Commitments and Appointments**
- **W:** Explain that managing their time is a key skill, and this week they will learn the language to schedule their academic and social lives.
- **H:** Show a cluttered, confusing calendar and a neat, organized one. Ask students: "Which person is more likely to be on time?"
- **E:** Introduce language for making appointments. Students will listen to and read dialogues of people making plans. They will practice scanning schedules and calendars for open times and identifying the meaning of phrases like "I'm afraid I'm busy" from context.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** In pairs, students will role-play making an appointment. One student has a list of available times, and the other must negotiate a time that works.
- **E (Evaluate):** Students will fill in the blanks of a dialogue where two people are making plans.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide scripts for the role-play for students who need more support, while encouraging others to create more complex negotiations.
- **O (Organize):** The week builds from vocabulary and phrases to practical, interactive application.
### **Week 3: Life in the City**
- **W:** Connect the week's topic to the itinerary project. "Now that you can manage your schedule, let's explore the city!"
- **H:** Show a fast-paced video montage of a vibrant city. Ask students to write down all the places they recognize or can name.
- **E:** Introduce vocabulary for places and transportation. Students will work with city maps, bus schedules, and tourist guides. The focus will be on scanning for information (e.g., "What time does the last bus leave?") and using context to understand signs and directions.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** Give groups a set of "errands" (e.g., mail a letter, buy groceries, get cash). They must plan the most efficient route on a map and write it down.
- **E (Evaluate):** A quick quiz where students match vocabulary words for places in the city with their descriptions.
- **T (Tailor):** Use a real map of Aguascalientes to make the activity more relevant. Provide a word bank for the errand-planning activity.
- **O (Organize):** The week is focused on practical, task-based activities that simulate real-life navigation.
### **Week 4: Food**
- **W:** Remind students of the final part of their itinerary project: choosing a place to eat. Explain that understanding food culture is a fun and important part of experiencing a new place.
- **H:** Bring in or show pictures of different kinds of interesting foods. Ask "What do you think this is? Would you try it?"
- **E:** Introduce vocabulary for food, cooking, and ordering. Students will read restaurant menus, recipes, and food blogs. They will practice all the key skills: getting general/specific info, identifying main ideas, inferring meaning (e.g., "sauté," "drizzle"), and finally, summarizing a recipe or a restaurant review.
- **R (Rethink/Revise):** Students will work on drafting and peer-reviewing their "Ideal Day Out" itineraries, paying special attention to the final section on food.
- **E (Evaluate):** The final project (itinerary and presentation) will be the main summative assessment.
- **T (Tailor):** Provide menu templates with varying levels of complexity. Allow students to create their itinerary as a written document, a slideshow, or a short video.
- **O (Organize):** The week is dedicated to applying all the skills from the unit into the final performance task, with a delicious and motivating theme.
