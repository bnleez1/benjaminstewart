# 🗂️ Monday
- “Can” vs. “Could”
    
    ### Using “Can”:
    
    **“Can”** is used to express:
    
    1. **Ability**: To show that someone is able to do something.
        - Example: “She **can** swim very well.”
    2. **Permission**: To ask for or give permission.
        - Example: “You **can** leave early today.”
    3. **Possibility**: To indicate that something is possible.
        - Example: “It **can** rain tomorrow.”
    4. **Requests**: To make a polite request.
        - Example: “Can you help me with this?”
    
    ### Using “Could”:
    
    **“Could”** is used to express:
    
    1. **Past Ability**: To talk about what someone was able to do in the past.
        - Example: “When I was younger, I **could** run fast.”
    2. **Polite Requests**: To make polite requests or suggestions.
        - Example: “Could you please pass the salt?”
    3. **Possibility**: To indicate that something is possible, often in a hypothetical or less certain way.
        - Example: “It **could** rain later.”
    4. **Conditional Situations**: To talk about what might happen under certain conditions.
        - Example: “If I had more time, I **could** finish this project.”
    
    ### Summary:
    
    - Use **“can”** for present abilities, permissions, possibilities, and requests.
    - Use **“could”** for past abilities, polite requests, hypothetical possibilities, and conditional situations.
    
    I hope this helps! If you have any specific examples or further questions, feel free to ask.
    
- Compare _can_ and _could_ activity.
