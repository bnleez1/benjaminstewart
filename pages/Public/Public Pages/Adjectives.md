## Comparative adjectives
## Superlative adjectives
**What are Superlative Adjectives?**
Superlative adjectives are used to compare three or more nouns. They indicate that one noun possesses the highest or lowest degree of a particular quality compared to all others in a group. They answer questions like "Which is the tallest?" or "Who is the most intelligent?"
**How to Form Superlative Adjectives**
1. **One-syllable adjectives:**
- Add "-est" to the end of the adjective (e.g., tall - tallest, fast - fastest).
- If the adjective ends in a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, double the final consonant before adding "-est" (e.g., big - biggest, thin - thinnest).
- If the adjective ends in "-e," just add "-st" (e.g., fine - finest, cute - cutest).
1. **Two-syllable adjectives ending in "-y":**
- Change the "-y" to "-i" and add "-est" (e.g., happy - happiest, lazy - laziest).
1. **Two or more syllable adjectives:**
- Use "most" before the adjective (e.g., beautiful - most beautiful, intelligent - most intelligent).
**Examples of Superlative Adjectives**
- **One-syllable adjectives:**
    - Mount Everest is the **highest** mountain in the world.
    - He is the **fastest** runner on the team.
    - This is the **hottest** day of the year.
    - She has the **least** amount of experience.
- **Two-syllable adjectives ending in "-y":**
    - This is the **happiest** day of my life.
    - She is the **funniest** person I know.
    - This is the **easiest** way to solve the problem.
    - He is the **busiest** person in the office.
- **Two or more syllable adjectives:**
    - She is the **most beautiful** woman in the world.
    - This is the **most expensive** car I've ever seen.
    - He is the **most intelligent** person in the class.
    - This is the **most efficient** method I've found.
**Exceptions to the Rule**
Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms that don't follow the standard patterns:
- **Good:** Best
- **Bad:** Worst
- **Far:** Farthest/Furthest (Farthest for physical distance, furthest for metaphorical or non-physical distance)
- **Little:** Least
- **Many/Much:** Most
- **Old:** Oldest or Eldest (Eldest is typically used for people in a family context)
**Examples of Exceptions**
- He is the **best** friend I could ask for.
- This is the **worst** movie I've ever seen.
- She lives the **farthest** from school.
- He is the **eldest** son in the family.
