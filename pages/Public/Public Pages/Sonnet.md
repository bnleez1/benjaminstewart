### [What is a sonnet?](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-sonnet-2985266)
A sonnet is a one-stanza, 14-line poem, written in iambic pentameter. The sonnet, which derived from the Italian word _sonetto_, meaning “a little sound or song," is "a popular classical form that has compelled poets for centuries," says [Poets.org](http://xn--from%20the%20italian%20sonetto%2C%20which%20means%20a%20little%20sound%20or%20song%2C%22%20the%20sonnet%20is%20a%20popular%20classical%20form%20that%20has%20compelled%20poets%20for%20centuries-d788j./). The most common—and simplest—type is known as the English or [Shakespearean sonnet](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-shakespearian-sonnet-2985265), but there are several other types (para 1).
Sonnets share these characteristics:
- **Fourteen lines:** All sonnets have 14 lines, which can be broken down into four sections called quatrains.
- **A strict rhyme scheme:** The rhyme scheme of a Shakespearean sonnet, for example, is ABAB / CDCD / EFEF / GG (note the four distinct sections in the rhyme scheme).
- **Written in iambic pentameter:** Sonnets are written in iambic pentameter, a poetic meter with 10 beats per line made up of alternating unstressed and stressed syllables.
A sonnet can be broken into four sections called quatrains. The first three quatrains contain four lines each and use an alternating rhyme scheme. The final quatrain consists of just two lines, which both rhyme. Each quatrain should progress the poem as follows:
1. **First quatrain:** This should establish the subject of the sonnet.Number of lines: four; rhyme scheme: ABAB
2. **Second quatrain:** This should develop the sonnet’s theme.Number of lines: four; rhyme scheme: CDCD
3. **Third quatrain:** This should round off the sonnet’s theme.Number of lines: four; rhyme scheme: EFEF
4. **Fourth quatrain:** This should act as a conclusion to the sonnet.Number of lines: two; rhyme scheme: GG (paras 4-5).
## **Sonnet Form**
The original form of the sonnet was the Italian or Petrarchan sonnet, in which 14 lines are arranged in an octet (eight lines) rhyming ABBA ABBA and a sestet (six lines) rhyming either CDECDE or CDCDCD.
The English or Shakespearean sonnet came later, and, as noted, is made of three quatrains rhyming ABAB CDCD EFEF and a closing rhymed heroic couplet, GG. The Spenserian sonnet is a variation developed by Edmund Spenser in which the quatrains are linked by their rhyme scheme: ABAB BCBC CDCD EE.
Since its introduction into English in the 16th century, the 14-line sonnet form has remained relatively stable, proving itself a flexible container for all kinds of poetry, long enough that its images and symbols can carry detail rather than becoming cryptic or abstract, and short enough to require a distillation of poetic thought.
## **A Summer's Day**
Sonnet 18 is probably the most well known of all of Shakespeare's sonnets:
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
